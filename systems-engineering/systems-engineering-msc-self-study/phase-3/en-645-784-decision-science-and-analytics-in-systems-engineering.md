## 1. Course purpose

This course develops the ability to structure, analyze, communicate, and defend consequential systems-engineering decisions. The learner will distinguish selection problems from design problems; translate stakeholder concerns into objectives and measures; generate and screen alternatives; identify Pareto-efficient options; use value models, visualization, optimization, experiments, surrogate models, and uncertainty analysis; and issue recommendations whose assumptions and limits are visible.

The goal is not to make a spreadsheet or algorithm select on behalf of the decision authority. The goal is to create a transparent, reproducible decision process in which objectives, evidence, preferences, uncertainty, and judgment can be examined and challenged.

## 2. Source scope and self-study adaptation

The current JHU syllabus separates the course into two major problem classes. The first half addresses **selection problems**, in which alternatives already exist and the analyst structures objectives, measures performance, identifies Pareto-efficient choices, ranks options, and communicates tradeoffs. The second half addresses **design problems**, in which alternatives must be created through architectural and parametric design, morphology, compatibility assessment, multiobjective optimization, design of experiments, surrogate modeling, and uncertainty analysis. [JHU-784-COURSE] [JHU-784-SYLLABUS]

The source course uses two major projects, module assignments and quizzes, a midterm, and a final. This self-study version preserves that balance through two controlled projects, weekly labs and retrieval checks, a cumulative Selection Decision Review, and a final Design Decision Review with oral defense. The source's family-vehicle and search-and-rescue UAV examples are replaced by one phase-consistent campus-mobility case without removing either the selection or design problem type.

## 3. Relationship to adjacent courses

### Inputs from earlier courses

The learner should import:

* the stakeholder, mission, requirements, architecture, risk, and verification baselines from Phases 1–2;
* the conceptual model, data, experiments, uncertainty records, and credibility evidence from EN.645.757;
* existing MOEs, MOPs, TPMs, cost/schedule estimates, operational scenarios, and unresolved decisions;
* the Phase 3 repository and reproducibility controls.

### Outputs to later Phase 3 courses

This course produces:

* an objectives hierarchy, measure dictionary, value-model rationale, and influence diagram;
* a reproducible selection analysis with dominance, Pareto, sensitivity, and recommendation evidence;
* a morphological and parametric design-space baseline;
* a multiobjective experiment, surrogate-model package, and uncertainty/robustness analysis;
* decision records and visualization patterns reusable in systems dynamics, metrics/M&S, MBSE analytics, and advanced simulation;
* explicit questions that later courses must answer rather than silently assuming the decision is closed.

## 4. Prerequisites and readiness diagnostic

Complete the following without outside help:

1. Write a decision statement that identifies the decision authority, alternatives or design freedom, timing, and consequences.
2. Distinguish a stakeholder need, objective, measure, constraint, requirement, and model output.
3. Calculate a weighted average, normalize a small dataset, and explain one danger of each operation.
4. Interpret a scatterplot, empirical distribution, correlation, confidence interval, and percentile.
5. Explain dominance and identify dominated points in a two-objective table.
6. Use a spreadsheet or script to filter rows, compute a score, and create a plot.
7. Explain why preferences are not facts and why model predictions are not observations.
8. Identify at least three ways a decision process can appear quantitative while remaining biased or nontransparent.

A learner below the standard should complete a one-week bridge on descriptive statistics, spreadsheet/Python data handling, requirements and measures, normalization, visualization, and reproducible analysis.

## 6. Essential questions

* What decision is actually being made, by whom, and when?
* Which objectives are ends, which are means, and which statements are constraints?
* What makes a measure decision-relevant, understandable, nonredundant, and measurable?
* How should stakeholder preferences be elicited and represented without pretending they are objective facts?
* When is an alternative dominated, Pareto-efficient, infeasible, or merely unattractive under one preference model?
* How can an analyst reduce a huge design space without deleting the eventual best option by accident?
* When do weighted sums conceal noncompensable thresholds or nonconvex trade spaces?
* What makes a visualization decision-useful rather than merely polished?
* How can experiments and surrogate models support search without becoming unexamined sources of error?
* What uncertainty matters to the decision, and what additional information is worth obtaining?
* What conditions would reverse the recommendation?
* How should disagreement among stakeholders be represented rather than averaged away?

## 7. Running case and controlled decision data

### Case — Autonomous Campus Mobility 2030 Decision Program

The university must select a near-term pilot package and then design a scalable campus mobility service for the following five years. The learner serves as the independent decision-analysis lead. The same mission context is used for both projects, but the decision models are deliberately separate.

### Project 1 — Selection from predefined pilot alternatives

The decision authority must select one of six predefined pilot packages for an 18-month demonstration. The synthetic baseline below is course data, not a real procurement.

| Alternative | Description | Five-year cost, $M | 90th-percentile wait, min | Accessible trip coverage | Deployment, months | Availability | Annual tCO2e | Integration risk, 1–5 |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| A | Fixed-route electric shuttle | 8.8 | 15.5 | 0.93 | 9 | 0.965 | 118 | 2 |
| B | Autonomous pod fleet | 10.6 | 9.8 | 0.88 | 16 | 0.940 | 86 | 5 |
| C | Demand-responsive accessible vans | 9.4 | 11.2 | 0.99 | 7 | 0.952 | 142 | 2 |
| D | Mixed shuttle-and-van fleet | 10.1 | 8.9 | 0.98 | 11 | 0.960 | 104 | 3 |
| E | Regional transit partnership | 7.6 | 18.4 | 0.90 | 6 | 0.935 | 126 | 3 |
| F | Refurbished incumbent buses | 6.9 | 20.1 | 0.86 | 5 | 0.910 | 215 | 2 |

Additional qualitative evidence addresses labor acceptability, cybersecurity exposure, regulatory dependence, campus disruption, learning value, and reversibility. The learner must not convert every qualitative issue into a fabricated precise number.

### Project 2 — Engineering design of the scalable service

The learner must generate an architectural and parametric design space using at least these dimensions:

| Design dimension | Required options or range |
|---|---|
| Service architecture | fixed-route, demand-responsive, hybrid, regional integration |
| Vehicle mix | shuttle only, van only, mixed, staged transition |
| Automation | human-operated, supervised autonomy, bounded autonomy |
| Dispatch policy | schedule, nearest-vehicle, zone-based, priority-aware |
| Accessibility configuration | fixed capacity, reservable capacity, dedicated accessible reserve |
| Energy infrastructure | depot charging, distributed charging, opportunity charging |
| Supervision | centralized, distributed, vendor-managed, mixed |
| Fleet size | 8–20 vehicles |
| Chargers | 3–10 units |
| Reserve ratio | 0–0.25 |
| Service-zone count | 2–8 zones |
| Maximum operating speed | 12–25 mph within applicable constraints |

The executable model from EN.645.757 may be used as an analysis engine, but its validity and computational cost must be carried into the decision analysis.

### Decision-owner roles

Formal reviews use four perspectives:

1. **Decision authority:** asks whether the recommendation is actionable, affordable, and aligned with mission.
2. **Stakeholder/value reviewer:** challenges objectives, measures, equity, thresholds, and preference assumptions.
3. **Analytics reviewer:** challenges data, transformations, algorithms, experiments, sensitivity, and reproducibility.
4. **Independent red team:** searches for omitted alternatives, hidden compensation, framing effects, and unsupported certainty.

## 8. Resource architecture

### Required backbone

1. **JHU course page and Spring 2026 syllabus** — source scope, two-project structure, topic sequence, software expectations, and outcomes. [JHU-784-COURSE] [JHU-784-SYLLABUS]
2. **NASA Systems Engineering Handbook** — stakeholder expectations, technical measures, decision analysis, alternatives, uncertainty, and lifecycle decision records. [NASA-SEH] [NASA-DECISION]
3. **NIST/SEMATECH e-Handbook of Statistical Methods** — experimental design, regression, diagnostics, and uncertainty foundations. [NIST-EHANDBOOK] [NIST-DOE]
4. **Dakota documentation** — multiobjective optimization, design of experiments, surrogate models, uncertainty quantification, and sensitivity methods for engineering analysis. [DAKOTA]
5. **General Morphological Analysis resources** — systematic generation and compatibility assessment for multidimensional qualitative/quantitative design spaces. [SWEMORPH]

### Tool and method resources

* **pymoo** for open multiobjective optimization and Pareto analysis. [PYMOO]
* **SALib** for reproducible global sensitivity analysis. [SALIB]
* **SciPy** for statistics, quasi-Monte Carlo sampling, optimization, and interpolation. [SCIPY-STATS] [SCIPY-QMC]
* **scikit-learn Gaussian-process and model-selection guidance** for surrogate modeling and validation. [SKLEARN-GP] [SKLEARN-MODEL-SELECTION]
* **Plotly Express or an equivalent plotting library** for linked, filterable decision visualizations. [PLOTLY-EXPRESS]

### Recommended books

These books are optional because the source course does not require a textbook:

* Ralph Keeney, *Value-Focused Thinking*;
* Gregory Parnell, Patrick Driscoll, and Dale Henderson, *Decision Making in Systems Engineering and Management*;
* Robert Clemen and Terence Reilly, *Making Hard Decisions with DecisionTools*;
* Kalyanmoy Deb, *Multi-Objective Optimization Using Evolutionary Algorithms*.

## 9. Tools and working environment

Use a spreadsheet plus one reproducible scripting environment. Python is the default because the source syllabus expects beginner Python and provides code examples, but R, MATLAB, Julia, or equivalent tools are acceptable when all analyses can be reproduced.

Minimum tool capabilities:

* tabular data cleaning, provenance, and transformation;
* constraint filtering and dominance/Pareto calculations;
* value-function and multiple-objective calculations;
* interactive or static visualization with accessible exports;
* design-of-experiments generation;
* regression or Gaussian-process surrogate fitting and validation;
* Monte Carlo or quasi-Monte Carlo uncertainty propagation;
* local and global sensitivity analysis;
* versioned notebooks/scripts and environment specification.

Maintain `/decision-data`, `/objectives-and-measures`, `/selection-project`, `/design-space`, `/experiments`, `/surrogates`, `/uncertainty`, `/visualizations`, and `/reviews` under the Phase 3 repository.

## 12. Major assignments and review products

### A. Decision Framing and Objectives Review

Define the decision authority, timing, scope, alternatives/design freedom, stakeholders, objectives, constraints, consequences, evidence plan, known biases, and decision-process governance.

### B. Project 1 — Selection Decision Package

Analyze the six predefined pilot alternatives. Provide objective and measure definitions, data provenance, constraint results, Pareto analysis, at least two selection methods, sensitivity/robustness results, visualizations, rejected-option rationale, and a bounded recommendation.

### C. Project 2 — Engineering Design Decision Package

### D. Cumulative Decision Reviews

The Week 6 and Week 12 reviews test whether the learner can reproduce calculations, explain method limitations, distinguish evidence from preference, respond to changed assumptions, and revise the recommendation when appropriate.

## 13. Common analytic rubric

| Dimension | Weight | Graduate-level evidence |
|---|---:|---|
| Decision framing and stakeholder value | 15% | Authority, context, objectives, constraints, consequences, and disagreement are explicit and traceable. |
| Measures, data, and transformations | 15% | Measures are decision-relevant; provenance, units, scales, missingness, normalization, and uncertainty are controlled. |
| Alternative/design-space quality | 15% | Alternatives are diverse and feasible; generation and screening are transparent; omitted regions are acknowledged. |
| Analytic rigor | 25% | Dominance, value models, optimization, experiments, surrogates, sensitivity, and uncertainty are correctly applied and diagnosed. |

| Reproducibility and communication | 10% | Data, code, figures, calculations, decision records, and revisions are reproducible and decision-appropriate. |

## 14. Critical mastery criteria

The course cannot be passed if any of the following remains true:

* the decision authority, timing, or decision scope is undefined;
* means objectives are treated as fundamental outcomes without examination;
* constraints and preferences are silently mixed;
* fabricated precision is assigned to qualitative evidence without rationale;
* a weighted score is used without showing scales, normalization, weights, and compensation effects;
* dominated or infeasible alternatives are retained as recommended options without explicit rationale;
* alternatives are screened out without a traceable rule and rejection record;
* the recommendation depends on one untested weight set, normalization, or uncertain input;
* Pareto efficiency is described as proving that an option is best;
* an optimizer or surrogate is treated as authoritative without verification and adequacy evidence;
* uncertainty is represented only by a best case and worst case when a distribution or structured scenario analysis is required;
* the dashboard hides missing data, uncertainty, or undesirable outcomes;
* the learner cannot reproduce a key calculation or revise the decision under a changed assumption.

## 15. Final capstone and oral defense

## Week 1 — Frame the decision, distinguish problem types, and expose decision-process risk

**Primary competency emphasis:** C1, C9, C12

### Professional context and essential question

Systems engineers often begin calculating before confirming what must be decided. **Essential question:** What decision is being made, by whom, at what time, with what authority, and what common failure modes could corrupt the process before analysis begins?

### Weekly learning outcomes

By the end of the week, the learner will be able to:

* distinguish selection, design, allocation, sequencing, portfolio, and policy decisions
* write a decision charter with authority, timing, scope, consequences, and exclusions
* separate decision quality from outcome quality
* identify framing, anchoring, availability, confirmation, sunk-cost, and automation biases
* create a pre-mortem and decision-process risk register

### Retrieval and readiness check

1. What is the difference between a decision and an analysis?
2. Why can a good decision produce a bad outcome?
3. What makes a problem a design problem rather than a selection problem?
4. Name three sources of decision-process bias.

### Required study

* **JHU course and syllabus** — decision-science motivation, taxonomy, selection/design distinction, and course outcomes. **Purpose:** preserve source framing. **Guiding question:** What changes when alternatives must be generated rather than selected?
* **NASA Systems Engineering Handbook, Decision Analysis** — decision context, alternatives, criteria, uncertainty, and records. **Purpose:** connect decision science to lifecycle practice. **Guiding question:** What information must be available to a decision authority?
* **Phase 3 README** — model/evidence and reproducibility rules. **Purpose:** align the decision repository. **Guiding question:** Which artifacts are evidence and which are governance?

### Instructor-style lesson notes

A decision is a commitment to action or allocation; an analysis is evidence offered to support it. The analyst does not own every decision.

Selection problems compare predefined alternatives. Design problems create alternatives through architecture choices and continuous variables. Allocation, sequencing, portfolio, and policy decisions require different structures.

Decision quality concerns framing, objectives, alternatives, information, reasoning, commitment, and implementation. Outcome quality also depends on uncertainty after the decision.

Frame decisions with authority, deadline, irreversibility, affected stakeholders, alternatives/design freedom, constraints, downstream decisions, and criteria for reopening.

Use a pre-mortem before analysis: imagine the decision failed and identify framing, data, preference, organizational, and implementation causes.

### Worked example

A committee asks, “Which shuttle is best?” The corrected decision is: “By 30 November, the vice president for operations will select one 18-month campus mobility pilot package, within a $3.5M pilot authorization, to improve peak and accessible mobility while preserving a reversible path to a five-year service.” This reveals authority, deadline, scope, budget, outcomes, and reversibility.

### Guided practice

1. Classify ten short scenarios by decision type.
2. Rewrite three vague problem statements as decision charters.
3. Run a pre-mortem for the pilot decision.
4. Create a decision-process risk register with triggers and mitigations.

### Independent exercises

* **Foundation:** Identify the decision authority, timing, alternatives/design freedom, and consequence in 12 scenarios.
* **Application:** Write the Project 1 and Project 2 decision charters.
* **Analysis:** Diagnose a flawed trade-study memo containing anchoring, omitted alternatives, and outcome bias.
* **Synthesis:** Conduct a Decision Framing Review using the four role perspectives.
* **Stretch:** Create a short script that validates required fields in a machine-readable decision charter.

### Weekly deliverable

Submit both decision charters, decision taxonomy, stakeholder/authority map, pre-mortem, decision-process risk register, review record, and revision log.

### Analytic rubric

| Criterion | Weight | Evidence of mastery |
|---|---:|---|
| Decision clarity | 30% | Authority, timing, scope, consequences, exclusions, and interfaces are explicit. |
| Problem classification | 20% | Selection and design freedoms are correctly distinguished. |
| Risk and bias analysis | 30% | Failure modes, triggers, mitigations, and organizational pressures are credible. |
| Governance and revision | 20% | Review decisions and changes are traceable. |

### Critical failures

* Decision authority or timing is absent.
* Selection and design problems are silently combined.
* A preferred solution is embedded in the decision statement.
* The pre-mortem is generic and disconnected from the case.

### Knowledge check and answer guidance

1. **What is decision quality?**  
   *Answer guidance:* The quality of framing, objectives, alternatives, information, reasoning, commitment, and implementation—not whether uncertainty happened to produce a favorable outcome.
2. **What is a selection problem?**  
   *Answer guidance:* A decision among predefined alternatives.
3. **What is a design problem?**  
   *Answer guidance:* A decision in which alternatives must be generated through architectural or parametric choices.
4. **Why use a pre-mortem?**  
   *Answer guidance:* To expose plausible failure mechanisms before commitment and reduce overconfidence.
5. **Who owns the decision?**  
   *Answer guidance:* The named decision authority; the analyst owns the integrity and communication of the evidence.

### Revision and mastery gate

The charters must be solution-neutral, reviewable, and accepted by the role-based review. All high decision-process risks need an owner or control.

### Suggested workload

| Activity | Hours |
|---|---:|
| Source study and retrieval | 2.0 |
| Framing and risk analysis | 3.0 |
| Review package | 3.0 |
| Revision and quiz | 2.0 |
| **Total** | **10.0** |

### Configuration and portfolio update

Commit source data, measure definitions, code/notebooks, environment, figures, decision records, review comments, and revisions. Update the assumptions, uncertainty, alternative/rejection, and decision-process risk registers before beginning the next week.

---

## Week 2 — Translate stakeholder values into objectives, measures, and value structure

**Primary competency emphasis:** C1, C2, C8, C9

### Professional context and essential question

Stakeholder statements often mix desired outcomes, proposed means, thresholds, and slogans. **Essential question:** How can the analyst represent what stakeholders value without confusing ends, means, requirements, and convenient metrics?

### Weekly learning outcomes

By the end of the week, the learner will be able to:

* identify fundamental and means objectives
* construct a nonredundant objectives hierarchy
* separate constraints from tradeable objectives
* define attributes, MOEs, MOPs, TPMs, scales, and direction of preference
* assess measure controllability, completeness, independence, and gaming risk
* draft single-attribute value functions where nonlinear preference matters

### Retrieval and readiness check

1. What distinguishes a need from an objective?
2. What is a fundamental objective?
3. When is a threshold a constraint?
4. Why can a convenient metric be a poor decision measure?

### Required study

* **JHU syllabus** — objectives, measures, alternatives, and stakeholder needs. **Purpose:** align the source sequence. **Guiding question:** How are selection and design objectives reused differently?
* **NASA stakeholder expectations and decision-analysis guidance** — stakeholder outcomes, measures, and alternatives. **Purpose:** link needs to decision criteria. **Guiding question:** How should measures reflect stakeholder expectations?
* **NASA technical measurement guidance** — MOE/MOP/TPM distinctions and measurement planning. **Purpose:** create a controlled measure dictionary. **Guiding question:** What decision does each measure support?

### Instructor-style lesson notes

Fundamental objectives describe why the decision matters; means objectives describe how a fundamental objective might be achieved. Means can become design assumptions if not challenged.

An objectives hierarchy should be collectively exhaustive enough for the decision and minimally redundant. Perfect independence is rare, but double counting must be diagnosed.

Constraints define infeasible or unacceptable regions. Tradeable objectives express preference among feasible alternatives. A threshold may be a requirement, policy, or stakeholder preference; label the authority.

Measures need definition, unit, scale, direction, range, source, uncertainty, timing, and owner. Proxy measures require an explicit causal rationale.

Value functions translate performance into preference for one objective. Nonlinearity represents diminishing returns, thresholds, or aversion—not physical behavior.

### Worked example

“Improve accessibility” becomes the fundamental objective “Provide equitable independent mobility.” Means objectives include low-floor vehicles and reservable spaces. Measures include accessible-trip coverage, 90th-percentile accessible wait, failed boarding rate, and user-reported independence. “Use low-floor vehicles” is not retained as a fundamental objective because it prejudges the design.

### Guided practice

1. Sort 25 stakeholder statements into fundamental objective, means objective, constraint, measure, or alternative.
2. Build a three-level objectives hierarchy.
3. Create a measure dictionary for eight leaf objectives.
4. Sketch linear and nonlinear value functions for wait time and cost.

### Independent exercises

* **Foundation:** Critique 15 candidate measures for ambiguity, redundancy, manipulability, and missing units.
* **Application:** Build Project 1 objectives and measures, including at least one equity and one reversibility objective.
* **Analysis:** Test for double counting between wait time, service reliability, and user satisfaction.
* **Synthesis:** Conduct the Objectives and Measures Review.
* **Stretch:** Implement reusable piecewise-linear value functions and unit tests.

### Weekly deliverable

Submit stakeholder-value interviews or reconstructed statements, objectives hierarchy, constraints register, measure dictionary, value-function sketches, redundancy/gaming audit, review record, and revisions.

### Analytic rubric

| Criterion | Weight | Evidence of mastery |
|---|---:|---|
| Value structure | 30% | Fundamental/means distinction and hierarchy are defensible. |
| Measure quality | 30% | Definitions, units, scales, sources, thresholds, and uncertainty are controlled. |
| Preference modeling | 20% | Value functions and directionality reflect stated preference without fabricating facts. |
| Review and traceability | 20% | Stakeholder statements trace to objectives and measures, including disagreement. |

### Critical failures

* A design feature is treated as a fundamental objective.
* A critical stakeholder outcome has no measure or reason for omission.
* Double-counted measures are aggregated without disclosure.
* Threshold authority is unknown.

### Knowledge check and answer guidance

1. **What is a means objective?**  
   *Answer guidance:* An objective valued because it contributes to another, more fundamental objective.
2. **What is an attribute?**  
   *Answer guidance:* A scale used to measure achievement of an objective.
3. **Why use a nonlinear value function?**  
   *Answer guidance:* To represent preference that changes nonlinearly over the performance range.
4. **What is double counting?**  
   *Answer guidance:* Giving the same underlying value influence multiple times through redundant measures.
5. **Can a qualitative objective remain qualitative?**  
   *Answer guidance:* Yes, if the evidence and judgment process are explicit; false precision is worse than disciplined qualitative evaluation.

### Revision and mastery gate

Every leaf objective must have an attribute or a documented qualitative evaluation protocol. Constraints and preferences must be separately authorized.

### Suggested workload

| Activity | Hours |
|---|---:|
| Study and stakeholder reconstruction | 2.5 |
| Hierarchy and measures | 3.5 |
| Value functions and audit | 3.0 |
| Review/revision | 2.0 |
| **Total** | **11.0** |

### Configuration and portfolio update

Commit source data, measure definitions, code/notebooks, environment, figures, decision records, review comments, and revisions. Update the assumptions, uncertainty, alternative/rejection, and decision-process risk registers before beginning the next week.

## Week 3 — Model decisions, uncertainties, evidence, constraints, and alternatives

**Primary competency emphasis:** C2, C7, C9, C12

### Professional context and essential question

A score table can hide causal assumptions and missing information. **Essential question:** What decisions, uncertainties, evidence, and consequences must be represented before alternatives are compared?

### Weekly learning outcomes

By the end of the week, the learner will be able to:

* construct an influence diagram with decision, chance, and value nodes
* identify observable, controllable, latent, and unresolved uncertainties
* create an evidence and data-acquisition plan
* generate alternatives from objectives rather than only incumbent options
* define constraints and rejection rules before seeing results
* maintain an alternative and rejection register

### Retrieval and readiness check

1. What information belongs in an influence diagram?
2. How does a constraint differ from a low value?
3. Why define rejection rules before scoring?
4. What is the difference between uncertainty and disagreement?

### Required study

* **JHU syllabus** — decision framing, alternatives, constraints, and stakeholder needs. **Purpose:** prepare selection analysis. **Guiding question:** What information must precede convergence?
* **NASA Decision Analysis** — alternatives, evaluation criteria, uncertainty, and records. **Purpose:** establish defensible trade logic. **Guiding question:** How are data gaps and assumptions recorded?
* **NIST e-Handbook** — data quality, exploratory analysis, and measurement considerations. **Purpose:** design evidence acquisition. **Guiding question:** Which data limitations affect comparability?

### Instructor-style lesson notes

Influence diagrams communicate structure, not merely chronology. Arcs represent informational or causal relevance and should have a stated interpretation.

Separate aleatory variability, epistemic uncertainty, stakeholder disagreement, and decision-control variables. They require different treatment.

An evidence plan maps each measure to source, collection method, timing, sample, uncertainty, transformation, and verification.

Alternative generation should start from objectives and constraints. Include incumbent, minimal-change, staged, hybrid, and deliberately different options.

Precommit rejection rules and preserve rejected alternatives with evidence. A screening rule is itself a decision assumption.

### Worked example

For the pilot selection, deployment time depends on vendor lead time and regulatory approval; availability depends on technical reliability and maintenance support; accessible coverage depends on vehicle configuration and scheduling policy. The influence diagram shows that “autonomy level” affects several outcomes through distinct uncertain mechanisms rather than receiving an unexplained risk score.

### Guided practice

1. Build an influence diagram for Project 1.
2. Map each measure to evidence source and uncertainty.
3. Generate two additional alternatives using objectives as prompts.
4. Define must-meet, conditional, and review-required screening rules.

### Independent exercises

* **Foundation:** Diagnose missing nodes and ambiguous arcs in three influence diagrams.
* **Application:** Complete the Project 1 influence/evidence model and alternative register.
* **Analysis:** Identify where common-cause assumptions create false independence.
* **Synthesis:** Run a framing-completeness review and approve the analysis plan.
* **Stretch:** Represent the diagram as a graph and automatically check for orphan measures and undocumented uncertainties.

### Weekly deliverable

Submit influence diagram, node/arc dictionary, uncertainty taxonomy, evidence plan, constraint/rejection protocol, expanded alternative register, review record, and revision log.

### Analytic rubric

| Criterion | Weight | Evidence of mastery |
|---|---:|---|
| Decision structure | 30% | Decisions, uncertainties, outcomes, values, and information timing are coherent. |
| Evidence plan | 25% | Measures map to sources, quality, uncertainty, and transformations. |
| Alternative quality | 25% | Options are diverse, objective-driven, and not limited to incumbents. |
| Screening governance | 20% | Constraints and rejection rules are predeclared and traceable. |

### Critical failures

* A consequential uncertainty is hidden inside a composite score.
* Alternatives are generated only from currently favored technology.
* Rejection rules are invented after observing scores.
* Evidence sources have no provenance or comparability assessment.

### Knowledge check and answer guidance

1. **What is a decision node?**  
   *Answer guidance:* A controllable choice owned by the decision authority.
2. **What is a chance node?**  
   *Answer guidance:* An uncertain quantity or event relevant to outcomes or information.
3. **Why predeclare constraints?**  
   *Answer guidance:* To reduce result-driven screening and make exclusion rules reviewable.
4. **What is epistemic uncertainty?**  
   *Answer guidance:* Uncertainty from incomplete knowledge that may be reduced with information.
5. **What is disagreement?**  
   *Answer guidance:* Different beliefs or values among stakeholders; it should not automatically be modeled as random variability.

### Revision and mastery gate

The influence/evidence model must cover every critical measure and constraint. Every removed alternative needs a recorded rule, evidence, and approver.

### Suggested workload

| Activity | Hours |
|---|---:|
| Study and retrieval | 2.0 |
| Influence/evidence modeling | 3.5 |
| Alternatives and screening | 3.0 |
| Review/revision | 2.0 |
| **Total** | **10.5** |

### Configuration and portfolio update

Commit source data, measure definitions, code/notebooks, environment, figures, decision records, review comments, and revisions. Update the assumptions, uncertainty, alternative/rejection, and decision-process risk registers before beginning the next week.

## Week 4 — Apply constraints, dominance, and Pareto analysis to the selection problem

**Primary competency emphasis:** C8, C9, C12

### Professional context and essential question

Rankings can conceal that some options are simply worse on every relevant dimension, while other options represent real tradeoffs. **Essential question:** What can be concluded before stakeholder preferences are aggregated?

### Weekly learning outcomes

By the end of the week, the learner will be able to:

* clean and validate a multi-criteria performance table
* apply feasibility constraints with traceable reasons
* normalize only when the downstream method requires it
* identify strict and weak dominance
* compute and visualize a Pareto-efficient set
* explain why Pareto efficiency does not identify a unique preferred option

### Retrieval and readiness check

1. What is dominance?
2. What is a Pareto frontier?
3. Do Pareto calculations require weights?
4. Why can normalization change a result?

### Required study

* **JHU syllabus** — constraints and Pareto frontier. **Purpose:** establish source-aligned analysis. **Guiding question:** What can be eliminated without preference aggregation?
* **NASA Decision Analysis** — evaluation and trade-space comparison. **Purpose:** connect Pareto reasoning to lifecycle decisions. **Guiding question:** What assumptions govern feasibility and comparison?
* **pymoo documentation** — dominance and Pareto concepts/examples. **Purpose:** implement and verify open calculations. **Guiding question:** How are minimization/maximization directions represented?

### Instructor-style lesson notes

Validate units, missing values, direction of preference, and evidence comparability before computing dominance.

Feasibility precedes preference. A constraint violation can exclude an alternative, trigger a waiver decision, or require redesign; do not silently assign a bad score.

Alternative X dominates Y if X is no worse on all considered objectives and better on at least one, under the stated direction and data. Uncertainty can make dominance indeterminate.

The Pareto set contains non-dominated alternatives for the included objectives and dataset. It does not prove completeness, fairness, or stakeholder preference.

Show the effect of adding/removing objectives and of measurement uncertainty on frontier membership.

### Worked example

Alternative D has lower wait, higher accessible coverage, higher availability, and lower emissions than C, but costs more and deploys later. Neither dominates the other. Alternative F may be dominated once cost is treated over five years rather than only pilot purchase price; the conclusion must state the cost boundary.

### Guided practice

1. Audit the Project 1 table for units, missing values, and direction.
2. Apply constraints and document feasibility/waiver outcomes.
3. Compute dominance manually for a subset and verify with code.
4. Plot two- and three-objective views and label uncertainty or data quality.

### Independent exercises

* **Foundation:** Identify dominated options in five small tables, including ties and mixed direction.
* **Application:** Produce the Project 1 feasible and Pareto sets.
* **Analysis:** Recompute the frontier after changing the cost boundary and adding labor acceptability.
* **Synthesis:** Issue an Efficient-Set Decision Record identifying which options advance.
* **Stretch:** Implement uncertainty-aware probabilistic dominance or interval dominance.

### Weekly deliverable

Submit validated performance table, data audit, constraint results, dominance matrix, Pareto set, plots, uncertainty notes, rejected/advanced alternative record, code, and tests.

### Analytic rubric

| Criterion | Weight | Evidence of mastery |
|---|---:|---|
| Data and feasibility | 25% | Units, directions, missingness, constraints, and waivers are controlled. |
| Dominance correctness | 30% | Manual and computational results agree and edge cases are handled. |
| Pareto interpretation | 25% | Efficient set and its limitations are accurately explained. |
| Reproducibility | 20% | Data, code, figures, and decisions are traceable. |

### Critical failures

* Maximize/minimize directions are inconsistent.
* An infeasible option is scored as though feasible without waiver.
* Pareto efficiency is called optimal or best.
* A changed objective set is not reflected in the interpretation.

### Knowledge check and answer guidance

1. **Does a Pareto frontier require weights?**  
   *Answer guidance:* No. It depends on objectives, directions, feasibility, and performance values.
2. **Can a dominated option be chosen?**  
   *Answer guidance:* Only with an explicit reason such as omitted objectives, uncertainty, constraints, or strategic considerations; the dominance result itself must not be hidden.
3. **What is weak dominance?**  
   *Answer guidance:* No worse on all objectives, with definitions varying on whether strict improvement is required.
4. **Why audit cost boundaries?**  
   *Answer guidance:* Different lifecycle boundaries can reverse comparisons.
5. **What does frontier membership mean?**  
   *Answer guidance:* No included feasible alternative is better on all included objectives under the stated data.

### Revision and mastery gate

The learner must reproduce frontier membership manually for a subset and explain how objective selection, data uncertainty, or constraints could change it.

### Suggested workload

| Activity | Hours |
|---|---:|
| Study and data audit | 2.5 |
| Constraint/Pareto computation | 3.5 |
| Visualization and analysis | 2.5 |
| Review/revision | 2.0 |
| **Total** | **10.5** |

### Configuration and portfolio update

Commit source data, measure definitions, code/notebooks, environment, figures, decision records, review comments, and revisions. Update the assumptions, uncertainty, alternative/rejection, and decision-process risk registers before beginning the next week.

## Week 5 — Converge on a preferred selection using transparent value and decision methods

**Primary competency emphasis:** C8, C9, C12

### Professional context and essential question

Once the efficient set is known, stakeholders still must express values and accept tradeoffs. **Essential question:** How can the analyst combine performance and preference without hiding compensation, scale effects, or disagreement?

### Weekly learning outcomes

By the end of the week, the learner will be able to:

* construct and test an additive multiattribute value model
* elicit or scenario-test weights and swing weights
* apply threshold, lexicographic, or outranking-style logic when compensation is inappropriate
* compare at least two convergence methods
* perform one-way, two-way, and break-even sensitivity
* document stakeholder disagreement rather than averaging it away

### Retrieval and readiness check

1. What assumptions support an additive value model?
2. What is a swing weight?
3. What is compensation?
4. When might a weighted sum be inappropriate?

### Required study

* **JHU syllabus** — converging on a preferred solution and multiple-objective selection. **Purpose:** structure Project 1 recommendation. **Guiding question:** Which method fits the decision context?
* **NASA Decision Analysis** — criteria, weighting, uncertainty, sensitivity, and recommendation records. **Purpose:** maintain transparent rationale. **Guiding question:** What should a trade study record?
* **Dakota or pymoo documentation** — scalarization and multiobjective selection concepts. **Purpose:** understand algorithmic limits. **Guiding question:** What trade-space regions can a weighted sum miss?

### Instructor-style lesson notes

An additive value model is transparent but assumes preferential conditions and compensability that must be examined.

Weights reflect importance over specified performance ranges, not abstract importance. Swing weighting asks about the value of moving from worst to best on each attribute.

Noncompensable thresholds, veto conditions, lexicographic priorities, or outranking logic may be appropriate for safety, rights, policy, or mission-critical outcomes.

Compare methods to learn whether the recommendation is method-dependent. A disagreement is evidence, not a nuisance to be removed.

Sensitivity includes break-even values: the weight, threshold, cost, or performance at which the preferred alternative changes.

### Worked example

A weighted value model prefers D, but C becomes preferred when deployment urgency receives a high swing weight. A threshold method excludes B because accessible coverage is below 0.90. The decision record reports D as preferred under the sponsor model and C as the robust fallback for accelerated deployment, rather than presenting one universal ranking.

### Guided practice

1. Build single-attribute value functions for five objectives.
2. Elicit three stakeholder weight scenarios.
3. Compare additive, threshold-first, and lexicographic results.
4. Compute break-even weights and identify unstable comparisons.

### Independent exercises

* **Foundation:** Calculate and audit a small multiattribute value model by hand.
* **Application:** Complete Project 1 convergence with at least two methods and three stakeholder scenarios.
* **Analysis:** Test normalization, weight, threshold, and data sensitivity.
* **Synthesis:** Draft the preliminary selection recommendation and dissent statement.
* **Stretch:** Implement robust rank acceptability across sampled weights and uncertain performance.

### Weekly deliverable

Submit value functions, weight-elicitation record, method assumptions, method comparison, sensitivity and break-even analyses, stakeholder scenarios, preliminary recommendation, dissent/limitations, code, and tests.

### Analytic rubric

| Criterion | Weight | Evidence of mastery |
|---|---:|---|
| Value-model integrity | 30% | Scales, ranges, weights, and assumptions are explicit and tested. |
| Method fit and comparison | 25% | At least two methods are correctly applied and limitations compared. |
| Sensitivity and disagreement | 30% | Reversal conditions and stakeholder-dependent outcomes are visible. |
| Recommendation discipline | 15% | Conclusion distinguishes evidence, preference, and authority. |

### Critical failures

* Weights are arbitrary or described as objective facts.
* A value model permits compensation across a prohibited threshold.
* Only one method/weight set is shown.
* Stakeholder disagreement is averaged without preserving scenarios.

### Knowledge check and answer guidance

1. **What is a swing weight?**  
   *Answer guidance:* The relative value of moving an attribute across its specified worst-to-best range.
2. **What is compensability?**  
   *Answer guidance:* The assumption that poor performance on one objective can be offset by better performance on another.
3. **What is a break-even analysis?**  
   *Answer guidance:* Finding the parameter or preference value at which the recommended alternative changes.
4. **Why compare methods?**  
   *Answer guidance:* To reveal dependence on method assumptions and decision structure.
5. **Who chooses weights?**  
   *Answer guidance:* Authorized stakeholders or the decision authority through a documented elicitation process; the analyst facilitates and tests them.

### Revision and mastery gate

The recommendation must survive a defined robustness region or be labeled conditional. Every noncompensable threshold must be enforced before aggregation.

### Suggested workload

| Activity | Hours |
|---|---:|
| Study and method setup | 2.5 |
| Value/weight modeling | 3.5 |
| Sensitivity and comparison | 3.0 |
| Recommendation revision | 2.0 |
| **Total** | **11.0** |

### Configuration and portfolio update

Commit source data, measure definitions, code/notebooks, environment, figures, decision records, review comments, and revisions. Update the assumptions, uncertainty, alternative/rejection, and decision-process risk registers before beginning the next week.

## Week 6 — Visualize, communicate, and defend the pilot selection decision

**Primary competency emphasis:** C8, C9, C12

### Professional context and essential question

Decision products often fail because they show rankings without causes, uncertainty, or alternatives. **Essential question:** How can visual and narrative evidence help the decision authority understand tradeoffs without manipulating attention?

### Weekly learning outcomes

By the end of the week, the learner will be able to:

* select visualization forms that match decision questions
* create accessible Pareto, profile, sensitivity, uncertainty, and evidence-quality views
* identify misleading axes, encodings, aggregation, and interaction defaults
* construct a concise decision report and briefing
* defend calculations and revise the recommendation under changed assumptions
* complete a cumulative midcourse retrieval assessment

### Retrieval and readiness check

1. What question does a parallel-coordinates plot answer?
2. Why can radar charts mislead?
3. What must accompany a ranked bar chart?
4. What makes an interactive dashboard reproducible?

### Required study

* **JHU syllabus** — visualizing tradeoffs, Project 1, and midterm synthesis. **Purpose:** complete the selection half. **Guiding question:** Which views support convergence and communication?
* **Plotly Express or equivalent official documentation** — accessible, filterable visualizations. **Purpose:** implement reusable figures. **Guiding question:** How are units, uncertainty, and hover/context preserved?
* **NASA Decision Analysis** — recommendation and decision record. **Purpose:** bind visuals to a controlled decision. **Guiding question:** What rationale and dissent must remain after the briefing?

### Instructor-style lesson notes

Start each visualization with a decision question. Do not choose a chart because it is visually impressive.

Use small multiples, value profiles, Pareto plots, tornado/break-even plots, uncertainty intervals, and evidence-quality annotations to expose causes of preference.

Avoid truncated axes, area encodings for precise comparisons, undisclosed normalization, hidden filters, default sort orders that imply rank, and color-only distinctions.

A dashboard needs a frozen export, data/version identifier, filter defaults, and interpretation notes. Interactive exploration cannot replace a controlled record.

The report should state the decision, efficient set, preference assumptions, robustness, dissent, recommendation, and trigger for reopening.

### Worked example

The dashboard places cost versus accessible wait on a Pareto plot, uses marker size for availability and shape for threshold status, provides value profiles for D and C, and includes a sensitivity panel showing the deployment-weight break-even. A banner states that B fails the accessibility threshold in the current configuration.

### Guided practice

1. Critique five misleading decision charts.
2. Build a decision-question-to-chart matrix.
3. Create a static briefing set and a controlled interactive view.
4. Conduct a red-team defense with a changed deployment deadline and accessibility threshold.

### Independent exercises

* **Foundation:** Redesign three misleading charts.
* **Application:** Complete Project 1 report, dashboard, executive summary, and decision record.
* **Analysis:** Test whether each visual reveals or hides uncertainty and preference dependence.
* **Synthesis:** Conduct the Selection Decision Review and midcourse exam.
* **Stretch:** Add accessible text summaries generated from controlled data and verify them against the figures.

### Weekly deliverable

Submit Project 1 data/code, objectives and measures, efficient-set and method analyses, sensitivity, dashboard/static exports, executive decision memo, dissent statement, midcourse assessment, defense record, and revised recommendation.

### Analytic rubric

| Criterion | Weight | Evidence of mastery |
|---|---:|---|
| Visualization integrity | 25% | Views match questions, preserve units/context, and avoid misleading encodings. |
| Integrated decision argument | 30% | Objectives, evidence, Pareto, preference, uncertainty, and recommendation cohere. |
| Defense and retrieval | 25% | The learner reproduces results and answers cumulative questions without tool dependence. |
| Revision and record | 20% | Challenges and changed assumptions produce traceable updates. |

### Critical failures

* The recommendation is communicated only as a total score.
* Interactive filters can change conclusions without recording state.
* Uncertainty or threshold failures are visually hidden.
* The learner cannot reproduce a critical calculation.

### Knowledge check and answer guidance

1. **Why show value profiles?**  
   *Answer guidance:* To reveal where alternatives gain and lose value across objectives rather than only showing totals.
2. **What is a decision record?**  
   *Answer guidance:* A controlled account of authority, alternatives, evidence, assumptions, rationale, dissent, decision, and revisit triggers.
3. **Why freeze dashboard exports?**  
   *Answer guidance:* To preserve exactly what the decision authority saw.
4. **What should a sensitivity visual show?**  
   *Answer guidance:* The parameter/preference change and whether/where the decision changes.
5. **What is the midcourse mastery test?**  
   *Answer guidance:* Ability to frame, structure, analyze, visualize, defend, and revise a selection decision.

### Revision and mastery gate

Project 1 must be accepted after review. The learner must reproduce one Pareto result, one value calculation, and one break-even result from source data.

### Suggested workload

| Activity | Hours |
|---|---:|
| Visualization study/design | 2.5 |
| Project integration | 3.5 |
| Review and exam | 3.0 |
| Revision and baseline | 2.0 |
| **Total** | **11.0** |

### Configuration and portfolio update

Commit source data, measure definitions, code/notebooks, environment, figures, decision records, review comments, and revisions. Update the assumptions, uncertainty, alternative/rejection, and decision-process risk registers before beginning the next week.

## Week 7 — Reframe the engineering design problem and generate alternatives through morphology

**Primary competency emphasis:** C1, C3, C9, C12

### Professional context and essential question

In a design problem, the candidate solutions do not yet exist. **Essential question:** How can the team create a diverse, feasible design space without letting the current architecture define the answer?

### Weekly learning outcomes

By the end of the week, the learner will be able to:

* reopen the decision around fundamental objectives and design freedoms
* define architectural and parametric variables separately
* construct a morphological field with mutually understandable options
* perform pairwise and higher-order compatibility assessment
* apply transparent pruning and decomposition rules
* measure design-space diversity and identify unexplored regions

### Retrieval and readiness check

1. Why reopen objectives for a design problem?
2. What is a morphological field?
3. What is compatibility analysis?
4. How can pruning create premature convergence?

### Required study

* **JHU syllabus** — design framing, morphology, compatibility, and data collection. **Purpose:** begin Project 2. **Guiding question:** How does design analysis differ from selection?
* **General Morphological Analysis resources** — field construction, cross-consistency assessment, and solution configurations. **Purpose:** generate architectures systematically. **Guiding question:** What makes two options incompatible?
* **NASA system design and decision-analysis guidance** — alternative generation and logical/physical solution exploration. **Purpose:** retain systems-engineering context. **Guiding question:** How should candidate designs trace to objectives and constraints?

### Instructor-style lesson notes

Reopen the problem. Project 1 selected a pilot; Project 2 designs a scalable service and may not inherit the pilot architecture.

Architectural variables are discrete structural choices. Parametric variables tune quantities within an architecture. Mixing them can confuse compatibility and optimization.

Morphological dimensions should be decision-relevant, distinct, and expressed at comparable abstraction. Options should be internally clear and collectively varied.

Cross-consistency assessment removes combinations that are physically, logically, policy, or operationally incompatible. “Unfamiliar” is not a valid incompatibility reason.

Prune in stages: hard incompatibility, minimum feasibility, decomposition, lower-bound screening, and analysis budget. Preserve counts and reasons.

### Worked example

The field combines service architecture, vehicle mix, automation, dispatch, accessibility, charging, and supervision. “Bounded autonomy + regional transit partnership + vendor-managed supervision” is not automatically inconsistent; the team must identify the actual operational/control interface. “Opportunity charging + no charging access” is physically inconsistent.

### Guided practice

1. Rewrite Project 2 charter and objective hierarchy.
2. Create seven architectural dimensions with at least three options each.
3. Conduct cross-consistency assessment with reason codes.
4. Calculate raw, compatible, and screened design-space size.

### Independent exercises

* **Foundation:** Repair a malformed morphological field with mixed abstraction and duplicate dimensions.
* **Application:** Build the Project 2 morphology and compatibility model.
* **Analysis:** Audit all incompatibilities for evidence and bias.
* **Synthesis:** Conduct the Design Space Review and approve the exploration boundary.
* **Stretch:** Implement constraint-satisfaction enumeration and diversity metrics.

### Weekly deliverable

Submit Project 2 charter, objectives update, architectural/parametric variable dictionary, morphological field, compatibility matrix and rationale, enumeration code, pruning funnel, diversity audit, review record, and revisions.

### Analytic rubric

| Criterion | Weight | Evidence of mastery |
|---|---:|---|
| Design framing | 20% | Objectives, freedoms, boundaries, and constraints are reopened and clear. |
| Morphological quality | 30% | Dimensions/options are coherent, diverse, and at appropriate abstraction. |
| Compatibility and pruning | 30% | Rules are evidence-based, traceable, and bias-audited. |
| Space accounting | 20% | Raw, feasible, sampled, and omitted regions are quantified. |

### Critical failures

* The pilot solution is treated as the required architecture.
* Incompatibility means “we do not like it.”
* Pruning rules or rejected combinations are not retained.
* Architectural and parametric choices are conflated without rationale.

### Knowledge check and answer guidance

1. **What is morphology?**  
   *Answer guidance:* Systematic exploration of combinations across multiple design dimensions.
2. **What is cross-consistency assessment?**  
   *Answer guidance:* Evaluation of whether option pairs or combinations can coexist under stated rules.
3. **Why count the design space?**  
   *Answer guidance:* To understand combinatorial growth, coverage, and what has been excluded or sampled.
4. **What is premature convergence?**  
   *Answer guidance:* Narrowing the space before adequate exploration or evidence.
5. **Why include a minimal-change alternative?**  
   *Answer guidance:* It provides a baseline and prevents innovation bias from excluding feasible low-risk choices.

### Revision and mastery gate

The Design Space Review must approve dimensions, compatibility rules, and the pruning funnel. No high-impact region may be removed without an explicit reason and reviewer.

### Suggested workload

| Activity | Hours |
|---|---:|
| Study and reframing | 2.5 |
| Morphology/compatibility | 4.0 |
| Enumeration and audit | 2.5 |
| Review/revision | 2.0 |
| **Total** | **11.0** |

### Configuration and portfolio update

Commit source data, measure definitions, code/notebooks, environment, figures, decision records, review comments, and revisions. Update the assumptions, uncertainty, alternative/rejection, and decision-process risk registers before beginning the next week.

## Week 8 — Formulate parametric design and conduct multiobjective search

**Primary competency emphasis:** C3, C7, C8, C9

### Professional context and essential question

A feasible design space may contain thousands or millions of combinations and continuous settings. **Essential question:** How should the analyst formulate and search the space without mistaking algorithm output for complete knowledge?

### Weekly learning outcomes

By the end of the week, the learner will be able to:

* formulate decision variables, objectives, constraints, and analysis functions
* encode mixed discrete/continuous designs
* distinguish weighted-sum, epsilon-constraint, and Pareto-ranking approaches
* run and verify a multiobjective optimization or structured search
* interpret Pareto ranks, convergence, diversity, and constraint handling
* identify unexplored or algorithm-sensitive regions

### Retrieval and readiness check

1. What is a decision variable?
2. What is a Pareto rank?
3. Why can weighted sums miss nonconvex regions?
4. What is the difference between search convergence and decision validity?

### Required study

* **JHU syllabus** — parametric design and introduction to multiobjective optimization. **Purpose:** preserve source sequence. **Guiding question:** How are design variables connected to objectives?
* **pymoo documentation** — problem formulation, constraints, algorithms, termination, and performance indicators. **Purpose:** implement open multiobjective search. **Guiding question:** How will convergence and diversity be checked?
* **Dakota documentation** — optimization and mixed-variable engineering analysis. **Purpose:** compare formulations. **Guiding question:** Which method fits expensive or constrained analyses?

### Instructor-style lesson notes

Define variables with type, bounds/options, units, owner, and feasibility logic. Define objectives with direction and computation source.

Mixed-variable design requires careful encoding; integer labels must not imply physical distance among categories.

Weighted sums are useful but can miss nonconvex frontier regions and collapse transparency. Epsilon-constraint and population-based methods expose different regions.

Verify the search with known test functions, repeated seeds, constraint checks, and comparison to enumerated subsets where possible.

Algorithm convergence means the search stabilized under its settings; it does not prove complete exploration, accurate models, or appropriate objectives.

### Worked example

A design vector includes architecture ID, fleet size, charger count, reserve ratio, zone count, and speed. Objectives minimize lifecycle cost, accessible wait, emissions, and service disruption while meeting safety, coverage, and deployment constraints. Repeated search seeds produce similar core frontier regions but disagree at high-automation designs, triggering more sampling.

### Guided practice

1. Create the design-variable and objective dictionary.
2. Implement feasibility checks and test them on edge cases.
3. Run a small enumerated/Latin-hypercube baseline.
4. Run a multiobjective algorithm and compare frontier coverage.

### Independent exercises

* **Foundation:** Formulate three engineering problems with variables, objectives, and constraints.
* **Application:** Run Project 2 multiobjective search and compute Pareto ranks.
* **Analysis:** Compare two algorithms or search strategies, repeated seeds, and termination rules.
* **Synthesis:** Conduct the Optimization Readiness Review.
* **Stretch:** Use epsilon-constraint sweeps to probe frontier regions missed by the primary algorithm.

### Weekly deliverable

Submit formal problem statement, variable/objective/constraint dictionary, analysis wrapper, unit and feasibility tests, baseline sample, multiobjective run records, Pareto ranks, convergence/diversity diagnostics, comparison, and review record.

### Analytic rubric

| Criterion | Weight | Evidence of mastery |
|---|---:|---|
| Formulation | 30% | Variables, objectives, constraints, units, and mappings are correct and traceable. |
| Search verification | 25% | Tests, repeat runs, and baseline comparisons challenge implementation. |
| Pareto analysis | 25% | Ranks, diversity, convergence, and limitations are accurately interpreted. |
| Reproducibility | 20% | Seeds, settings, environments, and outputs are controlled. |

### Critical failures

* Categorical variables are treated as meaningful numeric distances.
* Constraint violations enter the feasible frontier unnoticed.
* One algorithm run is accepted without checks.
* Convergence is claimed as proof of global or decision optimality.

### Knowledge check and answer guidance

1. **What is Pareto rank 1?**  
   *Answer guidance:* The non-dominated set; later ranks are obtained by removing earlier fronts and repeating.
2. **Why repeat optimization seeds?**  
   *Answer guidance:* To assess stochastic search variability and coverage stability.
3. **What is epsilon-constraint?**  
   *Answer guidance:* Optimize one objective while bounding others at specified levels.
4. **What is a mixed-variable problem?**  
   *Answer guidance:* A design problem containing combinations of continuous, integer, binary, or categorical variables.
5. **What is an algorithm performance indicator?**  
   *Answer guidance:* A measure such as hypervolume, generational distance, feasibility rate, or diversity used to assess search behavior—not decision truth.

### Revision and mastery gate

The search must pass feasibility/unit tests, repeatability assessment, and comparison to a baseline sample. Unstable frontier regions must be labeled.

### Suggested workload

| Activity | Hours |
|---|---:|
| Study/formulation | 2.5 |
| Implementation and tests | 3.5 |
| Search and diagnostics | 3.5 |
| Review/revision | 2.0 |
| **Total** | **11.5** |

### Configuration and portfolio update

Commit source data, measure definitions, code/notebooks, environment, figures, decision records, review comments, and revisions. Update the assumptions, uncertainty, alternative/rejection, and decision-process risk registers before beginning the next week.

## Week 9 — Design computational experiments to learn efficiently from the design space

**Primary competency emphasis:** C7, C8, C9, C12

### Professional context and essential question

High-fidelity analyses are often too expensive for exhaustive search. **Essential question:** Which design points should be evaluated so that the team learns about effects, interactions, curvature, and promising regions with defensible effort?

### Weekly learning outcomes

By the end of the week, the learner will be able to:

* define factors, levels/ranges, responses, blocks, nuisance variables, and randomization
* distinguish screening, factorial, response-surface, space-filling, and sequential designs
* create a computational DOE using factorial and/or Latin-hypercube/quasi-random sampling
* diagnose confounding, poor coverage, and failed runs
* estimate main effects and interactions with uncertainty
* update the experiment plan based on results

### Retrieval and readiness check

1. What is a factor?
2. What is an interaction?
3. Why randomize a physical experiment?
4. What does space filling mean in a computational experiment?

### Required study

* **JHU syllabus** — DOE and surrogate modeling. **Purpose:** prepare efficient data generation. **Guiding question:** What information must the experiment provide?
* **NIST e-Handbook DOE sections** — factorial, screening, response surface, and analysis principles. **Purpose:** establish experiment rigor. **Guiding question:** Which effects can the design estimate?
* **SciPy quasi-Monte Carlo and Dakota DOE documentation** — space-filling and computational designs. **Purpose:** implement reproducible sampling. **Guiding question:** How is coverage assessed?

### Instructor-style lesson notes

Begin with the decision question and analysis budget. Screening designs find influential factors; factorial designs estimate interactions; response-surface designs model curvature; space-filling designs support global surrogates.

Computational experiments do not need physical randomization for the same reason as field trials, but randomized execution can reveal infrastructure/time effects and protect against hidden run-order artifacts.

Replicate stochastic simulations or use controlled common random numbers according to the comparison goal. Record failed, infeasible, and censored runs.

Coverage should be assessed in the transformed input space and within each architecture family, not only globally.

Use sequential design: analyze the first campaign, diagnose gaps, then add points where decision value or predictive uncertainty warrants.

### Worked example

A two-stage campaign first screens fleet size, chargers, reserve ratio, zones, demand multiplier, and disruption rate. Fleet-by-charger and demand-by-reserve interactions are large. A second Latin-hypercube campaign concentrates on feasible high-service regions and balances samples across three architecture families.

### Guided practice

1. Define factors, responses, nuisance variables, and budget.
2. Create a small factorial screening design.
3. Create a space-filling design and assess pairwise projections.
4. Fit a preliminary model and choose sequential additions.

### Independent exercises

* **Foundation:** Identify estimable effects and confounding in four small designs.
* **Application:** Execute the Project 2 DOE/simulation campaign.
* **Analysis:** Diagnose coverage, interactions, failed runs, and architecture imbalance.
* **Synthesis:** Issue an Experiment Adequacy Decision Record.
* **Stretch:** Implement adaptive sampling based on prediction uncertainty and Pareto relevance.

### Weekly deliverable

Submit experiment objectives, factor/response dictionary, design selection rationale, run matrix, seed/randomization policy, execution log, failed-run disposition, coverage diagnostics, effect/interaction analysis, sequential update, code, and decision record.

### Analytic rubric

| Criterion | Weight | Evidence of mastery |
|---|---:|---|
| Experiment design fit | 30% | Design matches questions, factors, interactions, stochasticity, and budget. |
| Execution control | 20% | Runs, seeds, failures, and configurations are traceable. |
| Analysis quality | 30% | Effects, interactions, coverage, and uncertainty are correctly diagnosed. |
| Sequential learning | 20% | New runs target evidence gaps rather than convenience. |

### Critical failures

* The design cannot estimate a claimed effect.
* Failed runs are silently dropped.
* One architecture family dominates the sample without rationale.
* Stochastic noise is confused with factor effect.

### Knowledge check and answer guidance

1. **What is confounding?**  
   *Answer guidance:* When effects cannot be separately estimated from the chosen design.
2. **What is a screening design?**  
   *Answer guidance:* A design intended to identify influential factors efficiently, often with limited interaction resolution.
3. **What is a response-surface design?**  
   *Answer guidance:* A design supporting estimation of curvature and local response behavior.
4. **Why use a Latin hypercube?**  
   *Answer guidance:* To obtain stratified space-filling coverage of continuous inputs.
5. **What is sequential DOE?**  
   *Answer guidance:* Choosing additional experiments after learning from earlier results.

### Revision and mastery gate

The campaign must have documented estimability/coverage, controlled failures, and a justified sequential update. Key claimed interactions need adequate evidence.

### Suggested workload

## Week 10 — Build, validate, and use surrogate models without hiding approximation error

**Primary competency emphasis:** C7, C8, C9, C12

### Professional context and essential question

A surrogate can make expensive analysis searchable, but it adds another model layer. **Essential question:** When is an approximation good enough to support design exploration, and where must the original model remain authoritative?

### Weekly learning outcomes

By the end of the week, the learner will be able to:

* select an appropriate surrogate family for data, smoothness, dimensionality, and use
* split or resample data to assess generalization
* fit regression, tree/ensemble, polynomial response surface, or Gaussian-process models
* evaluate residuals, calibration, error by region, and ranking/frontier preservation
* propagate surrogate uncertainty or impose use restrictions
* compare surrogate-assisted search with original-model confirmation

### Retrieval and readiness check

1. What is a surrogate model?
2. Why is training error insufficient?
3. What is extrapolation?
4. Why can low RMSE still produce the wrong Pareto set?

### Required study

* **JHU syllabus** — surrogate modeling in design problems. **Purpose:** align source scope. **Guiding question:** What role does the surrogate play in convergence?
* **scikit-learn Gaussian-process and model-selection guidance** — fitting, validation, cross-validation, and uncertainty. **Purpose:** implement an open surrogate track. **Guiding question:** How is out-of-sample adequacy assessed?
* **Dakota surrogate documentation** — global/local approximations and model management. **Purpose:** define use controls. **Guiding question:** When should original-model confirmation occur?

### Instructor-style lesson notes

Choose the surrogate based on intended use: interpolation, screening, optimization, uncertainty propagation, or explanation. One model may not serve all purposes.

Reserve independent validation or use cross-validation appropriate to architecture groups and data dependence. Random splits can overstate performance when nearby design points are nearly duplicates.

Evaluate error in engineering units, relative to decision thresholds, and by critical regions. Check monotonicity or physics expectations where applicable.

Frontier preservation matters: a small average error can reorder close designs or create false Pareto points.

Confirm final candidate designs with the original model. Carry approximation uncertainty into optimization and robustness analysis.

### Worked example

A Gaussian process predicts wait time accurately in dense midrange designs but underestimates high-demand failure near capacity limits. A global RMSE of 0.7 minutes looks acceptable, yet several false-efficient designs appear. The use statement restricts the surrogate to screening and requires original-model confirmation within two minutes of the wait threshold.

### Guided practice

1. Fit two surrogate families to the DOE data.
2. Use grouped or stratified validation across architectures.
3. Plot residuals and error against inputs and thresholds.
4. Compare surrogate and original-model Pareto sets.

### Independent exercises

* **Foundation:** Diagnose leakage, extrapolation, and misleading validation in four examples.
* **Application:** Build the Project 2 surrogate package for at least two responses.
* **Analysis:** Assess regional error, frontier preservation, and uncertainty calibration.
* **Synthesis:** Conduct the Analytic Model Review and approve/restrict use.
* **Stretch:** Use active learning to add original-model points where surrogate uncertainty and decision relevance are high.

### Weekly deliverable

Submit surrogate intended-use statement, data split/resampling plan, candidate models, hyperparameter record, validation metrics and plots, residual/threshold/frontier analysis, uncertainty treatment, use restrictions, confirmation runs, code, environment, review record, and revisions.

### Analytic rubric

| Criterion | Weight | Evidence of mastery |
|---|---:|---|
| Method and validation design | 25% | Surrogate family and resampling fit the data and use. |
| Adequacy evidence | 35% | Error, calibration, regional/threshold behavior, and frontier preservation are assessed. |
| Use controls | 25% | Extrapolation, approximation uncertainty, and confirmation rules are explicit. |
| Reproducibility | 15% | Data, code, versions, and model artifacts are controlled. |

### Critical failures

* Training fit is presented as validation.
* Data leakage contaminates the assessment.
* The surrogate is used outside its validated region without warning.
* Final recommendations are not confirmed with the original model.

### Knowledge check and answer guidance

1. **What is generalization error?**  
   *Answer guidance:* Prediction error on relevant unseen data.
2. **What is extrapolation?**  
   *Answer guidance:* Prediction outside or beyond the support of training data, often with greater uncertainty.
3. **Why assess frontier preservation?**  
   *Answer guidance:* Decision use may depend on relative ordering and non-dominance rather than average prediction error.
4. **What is active learning?**  
   *Answer guidance:* Selecting new expensive evaluations based on model uncertainty and decision relevance.
5. **When is a surrogate adequate?**  
   *Answer guidance:* When evidence shows error and limitations are acceptable for a specified use—not universally.

### Revision and mastery gate

The review must issue accept, accept with restrictions, defer, or reject for each surrogate use. Final candidates require original-model confirmation.

### Suggested workload

| Activity | Hours |
|---|---:|
| Study and setup | 2.5 |
| Model fitting/validation | 4.0 |
| Decision adequacy analysis | 3.0 |
| Review/revision | 2.0 |
| **Total** | **11.5** |

### Configuration and portfolio update

Commit source data, measure definitions, code/notebooks, environment, figures, decision records, review comments, and revisions. Update the assumptions, uncertainty, alternative/rejection, and decision-process risk registers before beginning the next week.

## Week 11 — Analyze uncertainty, sensitivity, robustness, regret, and value of information

**Primary competency emphasis:** C8, C9, C12

### Professional context and essential question

A design that is preferred at nominal values may fail under uncertain demand, cost, regulation, reliability, or stakeholder preference. **Essential question:** Which recommendation remains defensible across plausible futures, and which uncertainty is worth reducing?

### Weekly learning outcomes

By the end of the week, the learner will be able to:

* classify aleatory variability, epistemic uncertainty, model-form uncertainty, preference uncertainty, and scenario disagreement
* propagate uncertainty through original and/or surrogate models
* perform local and global sensitivity analysis
* evaluate robustness, probability of constraint violation, regret, and decision reversal
* construct scenarios without double-counting probabilistic uncertainty
* estimate the decision value of additional information or testing

### Retrieval and readiness check

1. What is the difference between sensitivity and uncertainty analysis?
2. What is regret?
3. What is robust decision-making?
4. What is value of information?

### Required study

* **JHU syllabus** — decision making under uncertainty and related design concepts. **Purpose:** complete Project 2 analysis. **Guiding question:** How does uncertainty affect convergence?
* **NIST e-Handbook and Dakota uncertainty guidance** — propagation, Monte Carlo, diagnostics, and uncertainty quantification. **Purpose:** implement defensible analysis. **Guiding question:** Which distributions and dependencies are justified?
* **SALib documentation** — global sensitivity methods and assumptions. **Purpose:** rank influential inputs and interactions. **Guiding question:** Which method fits the input distributions and model cost?

### Instructor-style lesson notes

Keep uncertainty types separate. Aleatory variability may be inherent; epistemic uncertainty may be reducible; model-form uncertainty reflects representation; preference uncertainty reflects value disagreement.

Sensitivity asks how outputs or decisions respond to changes. Uncertainty analysis characterizes the distribution/range of outcomes given uncertain inputs.

Robustness can mean feasibility across scenarios, low regret, stable ranking, acceptable downside, or resilience to preference changes. Define it before calculation.

Correlated inputs and conditional scenarios matter. Independent sampling can create impossible worlds.

Value of information compares expected decision improvement with the cost, delay, and feasibility of obtaining information. Partial information can be more actionable than perfect-information calculations.

### Worked example

Design H has the best nominal value but a 24% probability of violating accessible wait under demand and charging uncertainty. Design M has 5% violation probability and low maximum regret. Additional winter charging tests have high value because they distinguish H and M; another survey of already stable cost preferences has little decision value.

### Guided practice

1. Build an uncertainty register with type, source, dependence, and reducibility.
2. Run Monte Carlo or quasi-Monte Carlo propagation.
3. Compute local and global sensitivity and compare rankings.
4. Evaluate constraint violation, regret, and reversal across scenarios/preferences.
5. Estimate the value and cost of one information-gathering action.

### Independent exercises

* **Foundation:** Classify 20 uncertainty statements and choose an appropriate treatment.
* **Application:** Complete Project 2 uncertainty, sensitivity, and robustness package.
* **Analysis:** Compare nominal preference, expected value, robust feasibility, and minimax-regret recommendations.
* **Synthesis:** Issue a Robust Recommendation Decision Record and information-acquisition plan.
* **Stretch:** Compute expected value of partial information for a selected uncertain input.

### Weekly deliverable

Submit uncertainty register, distributions/scenarios/dependencies, propagation code, sensitivity analyses, constraint-violation results, robustness/regret comparison, preference uncertainty, reversal map, value-of-information analysis, recommended information action, and decision record.

### Analytic rubric

| Criterion | Weight | Evidence of mastery |
|---|---:|---|
| Uncertainty representation | 25% | Types, sources, dependencies, ranges/distributions, and reducibility are justified. |
| Sensitivity and propagation | 25% | Methods fit the model and are correctly implemented/diagnosed. |
| Robustness and reversal | 30% | Feasibility, regret, preference, and decision stability are explicit. |
| Information value and limitations | 20% | Additional evidence is prioritized by decision value, cost, and timing. |

### Critical failures

* Uncertainty types are collapsed into one arbitrary range.
* Dependencies are ignored despite material effect.
* Sensitivity of outputs is reported without sensitivity of the decision.
* Value of information ignores collection cost or decision timing.

### Knowledge check and answer guidance

1. **What is global sensitivity analysis?**  
   *Answer guidance:* Assessment of input influence across their joint uncertainty ranges, including nonlinearities/interactions depending on method.
2. **What is regret?**  
   *Answer guidance:* Loss relative to the best decision that would have been chosen for the realized state or scenario.
3. **What is robust feasibility?**  
   *Answer guidance:* Meeting required constraints across a defined uncertainty/scenario set or with a specified probability.
4. **What is decision reversal?**  
   *Answer guidance:* A change in the preferred decision due to altered data, uncertainty, preferences, or assumptions.
5. **What is value of information?**  
   *Answer guidance:* The expected improvement in decision quality from reducing uncertainty, compared with cost and delay.

### Revision and mastery gate

The final candidate must be labeled nominal, conditional, or robust under explicit definitions. The top information action must have a decision-linked benefit and feasible timing.

### Suggested workload

| Activity | Hours |
|---|---:|
| Study and uncertainty design | 2.5 |
| Propagation/sensitivity | 4.0 |
| Robustness/VOI | 3.0 |
| Decision/revision | 2.0 |
| **Total** | **11.5** |

### Configuration and portfolio update

Commit source data, measure definitions, code/notebooks, environment, figures, decision records, review comments, and revisions. Update the assumptions, uncertainty, alternative/rejection, and decision-process risk registers before beginning the next week.

## Week 12 — Integrate, communicate, and defend the engineering design decision

**Primary competency emphasis:** C1, C3, C7, C8, C9, C12

### Professional context and essential question

The final task is not to present every computation; it is to make the decision process auditable and actionable. **Essential question:** What can the decision authority responsibly conclude, what remains unresolved, and what would cause the recommendation to change?

### Weekly learning outcomes

By the end of the week, the learner will be able to:

* integrate objectives, design space, experiments, models, uncertainty, preferences, and recommendation into one argument
* create executive and technical views for different users
* distinguish recommended design, implementation decision, and future decision gates
* defend the recommendation and reproduce key results
* respond to a surprise fact or stakeholder preference change
* explain how decision analytics supports innovation without replacing organizational judgment

### Retrieval and readiness check

1. What evidence chain supports the final recommendation?
2. What is the difference between design selection and implementation authorization?
3. What belongs in a reversal condition?
4. How can analytics inhibit innovation?

### Required study

* **JHU syllabus** — final project, cumulative exam, communication, and innovation-seeking organizations. **Purpose:** close the source course. **Guiding question:** What capability should the learner demonstrate beyond calculations?
* **NASA Decision Analysis** — final recommendation, rationale, records, and lifecycle integration. **Purpose:** issue a controlled decision package. **Guiding question:** Which assumptions and dissent must survive the review?
* **Phase 3 README and downstream course files** — systems dynamics, metrics/M&S, MBSE analytics, and advanced simulation. **Purpose:** create a disciplined handoff. **Guiding question:** What remains unanswered and which next method fits?

### Instructor-style lesson notes

Use an evidence chain: decision → objectives → measures → alternatives/design space → data/models → analysis → uncertainty/preferences → recommendation → conditions and implementation gates.

Separate the design recommendation from authorization to build or deploy. Additional safety, regulatory, contractual, or validation gates may remain.

Provide an executive view, a technical report, reproducible notebooks, and a controlled decision record. Each serves a different audience but must agree.

Innovation benefits from objectives-driven alternative generation and transparent exploration. Analytics can inhibit innovation when early metrics, incumbent data, or optimization formulations prematurely narrow the space.

The oral defense tests understanding, not presentation polish. The learner must reproduce calculations, explain limits, and revise responsibly when new evidence appears.

### Worked example

The final recommendation is a hybrid human-operated/supervised-autonomy architecture with 14 vehicles, six chargers, a 15% reserve, and priority-aware dispatch, contingent on winter charging validation and accessibility co-design. The decision record explicitly rejects immediate bounded autonomy deployment, preserves a staged option, and schedules a review after pilot data.

### Guided practice

1. Build the evidence-chain map and identify weak links.
2. Create a one-page executive decision view and a technical appendix map.
3. Rehearse the defense with a 20% cost increase, lower automation acceptance, and a new accessibility threshold.
4. Map unresolved questions to later Phase 3 courses.

### Independent exercises

* **Foundation:** Audit the complete package against the course critical-mastery criteria.
* **Application:** Complete Project 2 report, briefing, decision record, repository, and handoff.
* **Analysis:** Perform an independent red-team review and issue findings.
* **Synthesis:** Conduct the final Design Decision Review and oral defense.
* **Stretch:** Build a reproducible decision “run book” that regenerates all final tables and figures from controlled inputs.

### Weekly deliverable

Submit the complete Project 2 capstone, executive and technical reports, controlled dashboard/static exports, source/data/environment, evidence-chain and traceability maps, review findings, oral-defense record, revised decision record, portfolio manifest, and downstream handoff.

### Analytic rubric

| Criterion | Weight | Evidence of mastery |
|---|---:|---|
| Integrated evidence chain | 30% | All stages from decision framing through recommendation are coherent and traceable. |
| Technical and decision rigor | 25% | Design generation, search, experiments, surrogates, uncertainty, and preference are defensible. |
| Communication and governance | 20% | Executive, technical, and controlled records agree and preserve dissent/conditions. |
| Defense and adaptability | 25% | The learner reproduces results, explains limits, and revises under challenge. |

### Critical failures

* The recommendation exceeds the validated analysis or decision authority.
* Executive and technical products disagree.
* A surprise fact is dismissed to protect the original answer.
* The repository cannot regenerate key results.

### Knowledge check and answer guidance

1. **What is an evidence chain?**  
   *Answer guidance:* Traceable linkage from decision need through objectives, measures, alternatives, data/models, analyses, uncertainty/preferences, and recommendation.
2. **Why separate recommendation from authorization?**  
   *Answer guidance:* Other lifecycle, safety, regulatory, funding, or validation conditions may govern implementation.
3. **What is a reversal condition?**  
   *Answer guidance:* A stated change in evidence, assumptions, constraints, preferences, or context that would reopen or change the decision.
4. **How can analytics inhibit innovation?**  
   *Answer guidance:* By optimizing a prematurely narrowed design space or overvaluing what is easy to measure.
5. **What is the analyst’s final obligation?**  
   *Answer guidance:* Communicate what the evidence supports, what it does not, stakeholder dependence, residual risk, and what would change the conclusion.

### Revision and mastery gate

The learner must pass the oral defense, reproduce one selection and one design result, respond to a changed fact, and issue a final decision record with explicit authority, conditions, dissent, and revisit triggers.

### Suggested workload

| Activity | Hours |
|---|---:|
| Final integration | 3.5 |
| Reports and visualization | 3.0 |
| Review and defense | 3.0 |
| Revision and handoff | 2.0 |
| **Total** | **11.5** |

### Configuration and portfolio update

Commit source data, measure definitions, code/notebooks, environment, figures, decision records, review comments, and revisions. Update the assumptions, uncertainty, alternative/rejection, and decision-process risk registers before beginning the next week.
