# EN.645.667 — Management of Systems Projects

**Credits or equivalent effort:** 3 credits / approximately 120–135 hours
**Nominal duration:** 12 weeks
**Recommended weekly effort:** 8–11 hours
**Curriculum phase:** Phase 0 — Program foundations, readiness, and sequencing
**Course type:** Foundation / technical project management
**Primary program case:** Autonomous Campus Shuttle Pilot Deployment Proposal and Project Baseline

### 1. Course purpose and professional context

This course prepares the learner to manage a complex technical project from an initial opportunity and proposal through planning, authorization, execution, control, customer delivery, and transition to operations. The learner adopts the perspective of the project manager: the person accountable for integrating technical scope, schedule, cost, risk, resources, contracts, communications, and decision-making into an executable and controllable whole.

The course is not a general survey of office productivity or a substitute for advanced finance, contracting, organizational psychology, or systems engineering. Its distinctive purpose is to teach the management of **high-technology systems work**, where scope is represented by products and technical accomplishments, progress cannot be inferred from money spent alone, interfaces and configuration changes can invalidate plans, and the project manager must work continuously with the systems engineer and technical leads.

The source JHU course spans the project lifecycle from proposal to delivery and emphasizes the project manager's functions, roles, and responsibilities. Its published topics include planning and control, proposals, market and contract planning, WBS and work packages, work authorization, statements of work and objectives, critical-path networks, integrated planning, earned value, cost/schedule/performance assessment, estimating and pricing, risk, the project management office, communications, software development, specifications and technical-performance monitoring, reviews, conflict, leadership, quality, configuration management, and agile development. [JHU-667-COURSE] [JHU-667-SYLLABUS]

This self-study version preserves that breadth while replacing the enrolled course's team proposal with an individually controlled proposal and project-management baseline, optional peer review, recorded review briefings, scenario-based management decisions, reference calculations, and explicit mastery gates. It does not confer JHU credit.

### 2. Source description and scope

**Source course description — paraphrased**

The source course addresses management of a technical project from concept through operational use. It emphasizes the project manager's responsibility for conceiving, planning, budgeting, scheduling, monitoring, controlling, directing, and reporting the work from proposal development to product delivery. Communications, interface and configuration management, conflict resolution, WBS, EVM, critical-path networks, and practical problems in high-technology projects are central. [JHU-667-COURSE] [JHU-667-SYLLABUS]

**Self-study interpretation**

This course includes:

* the relationship among project management, systems engineering, project planning and control, product assurance, contracting, and technical authority;
* opportunity framing, market and stakeholder analysis, requests for proposal, compliance matrices, proposal strategy, statements of work, statements of objectives, and performance work statements;
* project charters, governance, decision rights, organizational structures, PMO functions, responsibility assignment, and work authorization;
* product-oriented WBS development, WBS dictionaries, product breakdown structures, organizational breakdown structures, control accounts, work packages, planning packages, and scope control;
* estimating methods, bases of estimate, pricing concepts, time-phased budgets, reserves, affordability, and estimate uncertainty;
* activity networks, precedence logic, duration and resource assumptions, critical path, float, milestones, schedule quality, and integrated master schedules;
* integrated baseline development and review across technical scope, schedule, resources, cost, risk, and responsibility;
* earned value concepts and calculations, variance analysis, indices, estimate-at-completion forecasting, management by exception, and corrective action;
* continuous risk, issue, and opportunity management, risk-informed decisions, contingency planning, and integration of risk with cost and schedule;
* configuration and change control, quality planning, data integrity, reporting rhythms, technical-performance measurement, interface management, and project and technical reviews;
* stakeholder communication, negotiation, leadership, conflict diagnosis and resolution, team performance, and ethical reporting;
* management of software-intensive and agile or hybrid technical work without abandoning integrated scope, schedule, cost, quality, risk, and evidence;
* preparation and defense of a credible technical-project proposal and execution baseline.

The course intentionally excludes advanced accounting, detailed federal procurement law, contract-administration certification, portfolio management, advanced organizational behavior, advanced stochastic cost and schedule risk analysis, and enterprise-scale governance. Later courses deepen agile execution, process improvement, decision analytics, systems integration, and complex-system management.

### 3. Relationship to the curriculum

**Builds on**

* EN.645.662 Introduction to Systems Engineering or equivalent introductory systems-engineering competence;
* the `BL3-Concept` system baseline and `662_handoff.md` produced in EN.645.662;
* basic spreadsheet calculations, technical writing, diagramming, and file configuration control;
* introductory understanding of requirements, architecture, interfaces, risk, technical reviews, verification, and validation.

**Concurrent-study policy**

The course may be started concurrently with EN.645.662 only after the learner has completed Weeks 1–6 of EN.645.662 and can demonstrate a coherent problem, stakeholder, requirement, and functional baseline. The recommended first-pass sequence remains EN.645.662 followed by EN.645.667.

**Prepares for**

* EN.645.764 Software Systems Engineering;
* EN.645.767 System Conceptual Design and the later design, integration, and test lifecycle chain;
* EN.645.780 Agile Systems Engineering;
* EN.645.783 Systems Engineering Process Improvement;
* management, affordability, schedule, risk, technical-performance, and review work in every later course.

**Artifact continuity**

The learner imports the EN.645.662 shuttle concept baseline and turns it into a controlled project proposal and execution baseline. This course produces:

* opportunity statement, project charter, governance map, and project-management strategy;
* fictional RFP compliance matrix and proposal outline;
* product-oriented WBS and WBS dictionary linked to the prior PBS and architecture;
* organizational breakdown structure, responsibility-assignment matrix, control accounts, work packages, and work-authorization records;
* basis of estimate, cost estimate, time-phased budget, pricing summary, and reserve rationale;
* integrated master schedule with network logic, critical path, milestones, and schedule-quality checks;
* integrated scope-schedule-cost baseline and Integrated Baseline Review record;
* earned-value measurement plan, status dataset, variance analysis, forecasts, and corrective-action recommendation;
* risk, issue, opportunity, change, quality, communications, stakeholder, and configuration-management plans;
* technical-performance and interface-control reporting plan;
* software/agile or hybrid delivery-management appendix;
* final proposal, project-management plan, briefing, oral defense, and course handoff record.

Later courses may revise the technical scope or architecture, but should preserve the management-baseline history, assumptions, and change log.

### 4. Prerequisites and readiness assessment

**Required prior competencies**

* satisfy EN.645.662-CLO-1 through EN.645.662-CLO-5 at an introductory level, or demonstrate equivalent competence;
* distinguish stakeholder needs, requirements, architecture descriptions, interfaces, verification, validation, risk, and configuration baselines;
* construct and interpret a simple hierarchy, table, flowchart, and block diagram;
* calculate percentages, weighted values, basic rates, and simple spreadsheet formulas;
* write a concise technical memo that separates facts, assumptions, analysis, and recommendation;
* maintain a versioned repository or equivalent controlled file structure.

**Recommended preparation**

* experience participating in a technical project or product-development team;
* familiarity with calendar scheduling, spreadsheet charts, and presentation software;
* exposure to budgets, vendor work, software iterations, reviews, or project status meetings.

**Required tools and access**

* Git and a repository, or a disciplined local version-control substitute;
* Markdown editor and PDF annotation tool;
* spreadsheet software capable of formulas, pivot tables, and charts;
* project-scheduling software capable of precedence links, milestones, baselines, critical-path calculation, and export to CSV or PDF;
* presentation software;
* optional: Python or another scripting environment for cross-checking schedule and EVM calculations.

**Readiness diagnostic — 75 minutes**

1. **Project-management and systems-engineering distinction — 15 minutes, 20 points**
   Explain the difference between technical scope definition and project planning and control, then identify four areas of shared responsibility.
2. **WBS and responsibility task — 20 minutes, 25 points**
   Given a small sensor-deployment project, create a two-level product-oriented WBS and assign an owner to each level-2 element.
3. **Network and critical-path task — 20 minutes, 30 points**
   Calculate earliest finish, latest start, total float, and the critical path for a six-activity precedence network.
4. **Cost and status task — 20 minutes, 25 points**
   Given planned value, earned value, actual cost, and budget at completion, calculate schedule variance, cost variance, SPI, CPI, and one estimate at completion, then explain the result in plain language.

**Passing standard**

* 70% overall;
* at least 50% on each component;
* correct identification of the critical path;
* no claim that expenditure alone demonstrates progress.

**Recovery path**

A learner below threshold completes a one-week bridge using NASA Project Planning and Control Handbook §§1.2–2.3, the GAO Schedule Assessment Guide's *Concepts* section, and the DOE introductory EVM tutorial; reproduces one WBS/network/EVM worked example; and retakes a parallel diagnostic.

### 6. Essential questions

* How does a project manager know whether a technical project is actually making progress rather than merely spending money and completing activities?
* What evidence makes a proposal and execution baseline credible to a customer, sponsor, technical team, and independent reviewer?
* How should scope, schedule, cost, technical performance, resources, risk, and responsibility be integrated so that a change in one is visible in the others?
* When should a variance trigger management action, and how can corrective action avoid causing greater downstream harm?
* How should the project manager and systems engineer divide and share responsibility without creating either a technical or business-management blind spot?
* How can leadership, communication, conflict resolution, quality, configuration control, and ethical reporting preserve trust when the project is under pressure?
* What must change—and what must not disappear—when a software-intensive project adopts agile or hybrid delivery?

### 7. Running case, datasets, and problem environment

**Case brief**

The learner acts as project manager for **Campus Mobility Systems Integrator (CMSI)**, a fictional organization responding to a university's request for proposal to design, integrate, deploy, demonstrate, and transition an Autonomous Campus Shuttle Pilot Service. The technical concept is inherited from EN.645.662, but the customer now requires a credible proposal and project-execution baseline.

The fictional acquisition includes:

* an 18-month period from notice to proceed through operational acceptance;
* two low-speed automated shuttles, charging infrastructure, route and stop modifications, an operations workstation, rider-information interfaces, safety and accessibility evidence, and a 90-day operational pilot;
* integration with campus identity, security dispatch, emergency response, network, mapping, maintenance, and facilities organizations;
* a customer target budget of **$8.0 million** and a not-to-exceed proposal price of **$8.8 million**;
* required readiness events at Project Kickoff, System Requirements Review, Preliminary Design Review, Critical Design Review, Test Readiness Review, Operational Readiness Review, and Final Acceptance Review;
* a proposal due in six weeks and a customer preference for measurable progress, early risk retirement, transparent reporting, and controlled interfaces;
* a software and data-integration workstream expected to use incremental delivery inside the larger integrated project baseline;
* uncertain permitting, supplier lead times, cybersecurity authorization, seasonal weather, and stakeholder acceptance.

All numbers, organizations, and events are educational inputs and are not claims about a real campus or autonomous-shuttle program.

**Provided materials**

* EN.645.662 `BL3-Concept` baseline and `662_handoff.md`;
* fictional RFP with instructions, evaluation factors, schedule constraints, required data items, and proposal-volume outline;
* RFP compliance-matrix template;
* preliminary PBS, architecture, requirement, interface, risk, and V&V exports from EN.645.662;
* historical analog-project dataset with labor categories, material costs, schedule durations, and uncertainty ranges;
* WBS dictionary, basis-of-estimate, network-schedule, EVM, risk, change-request, communications, quality, and review templates;
* deliberately defective WBS, schedule, EVM status report, and executive dashboard for diagnostic exercises;
* Month 5 project-status dataset containing planned value, earned value, actual cost, milestone slips, supplier problems, technical-performance trends, and proposed changes;
* stakeholder-role cards for sponsor, customer, systems engineer, safety lead, software lead, supplier, operator, finance lead, contracting officer, and independent reviewer.

**Configuration rules**

Use repository root `645667_shuttle_project/` with:

* `00_admin/` — syllabus map, reading log, time log, rubric records;
* `01_rfp_and_proposal/` — RFP, compliance matrix, proposal drafts, questions and assumptions;
* `02_scope_and_org/` — charter, governance, WBS/PBS/OBS, RAM, work authorization;
* `03_cost_and_schedule/` — estimates, basis of estimate, budget, schedule, baseline and status files;
* `04_controls/` — EVM, risk, issue, opportunity, change, configuration, quality, TPM and interface controls;
* `05_reviews_and_reports/` — IBR, status reviews, crisis review, proposal review, final briefing;
* `06_decisions_and_logs/` — decision, assumption, action, finding, change, and lessons logs;
* `07_capstone/` — final proposal, project-management plan, exports, defense, and retrospective.

Use identifiers `WBS-x`, `CA-x`, `WP-x`, `SCH-x`, `BOE-x`, `RISK-x`, `ISSUE-x`, `OPP-x`, `CR-x`, `TPM-x`, `DEC-x`, and `FND-x`. Every cost account and schedule activity must trace to authorized scope. Baseline tags are:

* `PM-BL0-Opportunity` after Week 2;
* `PM-BL1-Scope` after Week 3;
* `PM-BL2-Integrated` after the Week 6 IBR and corrective action;
* `PM-BL3-Proposal` after Week 12.

No baseline value is overwritten without an approved change record. Forecast updates are distinguished from baseline changes.

**Alternate case policy**

A substitute case is permitted only when it contains:

* at least five technical or organizational workstreams;
* hardware, software, operations, or supplier interfaces;
* a realistic customer opportunity or charter;
* a target cost and delivery constraint;
* enough uncertainty to require risk, reserves, and iterative planning;
* at least three formal reviews or acceptance events;
* a progress-measurement problem that cannot be solved by expenditure tracking alone.

The learner must create an equivalent RFP, historical-data pack, Month 5 status dataset, and configuration scheme before Week 2.

### 9. Tool stack and technical setup

| Tool or environment | Purpose | Required or optional | Setup evidence |
|---|---|:---:|---|
| Git or controlled local repository | Baseline, revision, change, and audit history | Required | Initial commit, folder structure, and `PM-BL0` test tag |
| Spreadsheet software | Estimates, time-phased budgets, EVM, risk, resource and dashboard analysis | Required | Executed formula-check workbook with visible formulas |
| Project-scheduling tool | Network logic, calendars, critical path, float, baselines, status and exports | Required | Six-activity CPM network showing calculated critical path |
| Markdown editor | Charters, plans, logs, memos, proposal text and review records | Required | Rendered charter template |
| Presentation software | IBR, status, proposal, and oral-defense briefings | Required | Five-slide setup briefing |
| PDF annotation tool | Review of RFP, guides, proposal and review findings | Required | Annotated RFP excerpt |
| Python notebook or script | Independent CPM/EVM cross-checks and data quality checks | Optional | Reproduced diagnostic calculation |
| Collaboration platform | Optional peer review or team version of the proposal | Optional | Shared review record or meeting notes |

**Scheduling-tool acceptance test**

The tool must support finish-to-start links, at least one other relationship type, activity calendars, milestones, constraints, baselines, status date, actual start/finish, remaining duration, total float, critical path, and CSV or spreadsheet export. A simple task list without network calculation is insufficient.

**Spreadsheet control rules**

* separate inputs, calculations, and outputs;
* use units in column headers;
* avoid unexplained hard-coded values inside formulas;
* include formula checks and reconciliation totals;
* record source, date, estimator, uncertainty, and rationale for each basis-of-estimate element;
* protect baseline sheets or preserve immutable exported copies.

### 10. Instructional and assessment strategy

The course uses a repeated management-learning cycle:

1. retrieve the relevant technical baseline and management distinction;
2. study one planning or control method;
3. reproduce a bounded worked example;
4. inspect a defective artifact and diagnose its management consequences;
5. apply the method to the shuttle project;
6. cross-check calculations and traceability;
7. brief the result from the project manager's perspective;
8. receive or simulate review findings;
9. revise and baseline the artifact;
10. update the integrated project story rather than storing another disconnected document.

**Assessment structure**

| Assessment category | Weight | Purpose |
|---|---:|---|
| Weekly knowledge checks and retrieval practice | 10% | Confirm terminology, distinctions, formulas, and tool selection |
| Guided project-controls laboratories | 15% | Build procedural accuracy in WBS, estimating, CPM, EVM, and control methods |
| Independent weekly case applications | 20% | Apply management methods to the controlled shuttle project |
| Proposal, leadership, and management-decision memos | 10% | Develop customer responsiveness, judgment, and executive communication |
| Midcourse Integrated Baseline Review and revision | 15% | Test scope-schedule-cost-risk integration and baseline credibility |
| Integrated project-control crisis analysis | 5% | Diagnose interacting technical and management problems under pressure |
| Final proposal, project-management baseline, briefing, and oral defense | 25% | Demonstrate integrated independent mastery |
| **Total** | **100%** |  |

**Self-study adaptation of participation and teamwork**

The source course uses discussions, quizzes, team participation, assignments, examinations, and a team proposal. In this curriculum:

* discussion is replaced by written position-and-rebuttal notes or peer discussion when available;
* team participation is replaced by role-based review, optional peer evaluation, and an individual contribution/accountability log;
* examinations are replaced by timed scenario analyses and oral defense;
* the team proposal becomes an individual proposal unless the learner chooses the team option;
* deficient major artifacts must be revised, preserving the source course's emphasis on resubmission and learning from feedback. [JHU-667-SYLLABUS]

Use Larson and Gray, *Project Management: The Managerial Process*, 7th ed. or a later comparable edition for explanatory chapters on project selection, organization, scope, estimating, scheduling, risk, leadership, teams, outsourcing, and agile project management. Record exact chapter numbers used in `reading_log.md`. The open NASA, GAO, DOE, FAR, and SEBoK/NASA systems-engineering resources remain sufficient for the required baseline.

### 11A. Fully developed weekly instructional units

The units below operationalize the reusable weekly template. Each week produces a controlled management artifact, requires calculation or evidence checks where applicable, and updates the integrated project story. The answer guidance confirms core distinctions but does not replace the independent project work.

#### Common fictional project data used in worked examples

Unless a week provides different values, use the following educational planning data for the Autonomous Campus Shuttle Pilot. These values are fictional and are not claims about a real university, supplier, or autonomous-vehicle program.

* project duration target: 18 months from notice to proceed through final acceptance;
* customer target budget: $8.0 million; proposal price must not exceed $8.8 million;
* planning basis: performance measurement baseline of $7.2 million, management reserve of $0.6 million, and proposed fee of $0.6 million, subject to revision through the course;
* major workstreams: program management, systems engineering, vehicles, charging/site infrastructure, operations center, software/data integration, safety/cybersecurity assurance, verification and validation, training/transition, and pilot operations;
* lifecycle reviews: kickoff, SRR, PDR, CDR, TRR, ORR, and Final Acceptance Review;
* software/data workstream: four planned increments integrated with system-level reviews;
* high-uncertainty drivers: permitting, battery and sensor supplier lead times, cybersecurity authorization, winter weather, route-accessibility modifications, and stakeholder acceptance;
* Month 5 status dataset used in Weeks 7 and 10: BAC $7.2M, PV $2.40M, EV $2.04M, AC $2.55M, one major supplier six weeks late, software integration 35% behind its planned backlog burn-down, and obstacle-detection false stops trending at seven per operating hour against an interim threshold of two.

### Week 1 — The technical project manager, governance, and PM–SE integration

**Professional context and essential question**

Technical projects fail when authority, responsibility, and information flow are ambiguous. A project manager can own cost and schedule yet still fail if technical decisions, risk acceptance, work authorization, and escalation paths are not explicit.

**Essential question:** What is the project manager accountable for, and how will authority and information flow?

**Outcome alignment**

By the end of the week, the learner will be able to:

1. distinguish project management, systems engineering, project planning and control, technical authority, product assurance, and specialist engineering;
2. define project objectives, scope boundaries, lifecycle, success criteria, assumptions, and constraints;
3. construct a governance model with decision rights, escalation routes, and review authority;
4. define a management rhythm linking technical reviews, status reporting, risk review, change control, and executive decisions;
5. identify at least six shared PM–SE responsibilities and assign accountable and supporting roles;
6. establish the first controlled management baseline.

**Prerequisite retrieval and readiness check — 30 minutes**

Without consulting the readings:

1. explain why technical scope cannot be managed only as a list of tasks;
2. identify four artifacts from EN.645.662 that should constrain project planning;
3. distinguish accountability from responsibility and authority;
4. sketch a governance chain from work-package lead to project executive;
5. restore a prior version of a charter file and create a repository tag.

Failure on Item 5 requires completion of the configuration-control recovery exercise before continuing.

**Required readings and resources — approximately 2.5 hours**

* JHU 645.667 course page and syllabus. Identify the source course’s expected breadth and the project manager’s lifecycle responsibilities. [JHU-667-COURSE] [JHU-667-SYLLABUS]
* NASA PP&C Handbook §§1.2–1.4 and §§2.1–2.3. Focus on integrated planning and control and the relationships among project management, systems engineering, resources, schedule, and cost. [NASA-PPC]
* NASA PM Handbook introductory and project-management overview material. Focus on governance, formulation, implementation, and the project manager’s accountability. [NASA-PM-HDBK]

**Guiding questions**

* Which decisions can the project manager make alone, and which require technical authority or sponsor approval?
* How should bad news move through the organization?
* Which technical-baseline changes necessarily affect project commitments?

**Instructor-style lesson notes**

Project management integrates commitments; systems engineering integrates the technical definition and evidence. The project manager is accountable for creating an executable plan, securing resources, authorizing work, monitoring performance, managing stakeholders, and recommending action. The systems engineer is accountable for technical coherence, requirements and architecture integration, technical risk, interfaces, and evidence. Neither role succeeds in isolation.

Governance is more than an organization chart. It defines who decides, who recommends, who must concur, which thresholds trigger escalation, and what evidence is required. A useful governance model distinguishes routine execution decisions, technical baseline decisions, contractual commitments, risk acceptance, and safety or mission-assurance decisions.

A management rhythm should connect weekly team execution, biweekly technical coordination, monthly integrated status review, periodic risk and change boards, and lifecycle reviews. Meetings without specified inputs, decisions, owners, and outputs create activity rather than control.

**Worked example — change in route scope**

The customer asks whether a fourth stop can be added after the requirements baseline.

* The project manager assesses contractual scope, cost, schedule, resource, and customer effects.
* The systems engineer assesses requirements, architecture, interfaces, safety, accessibility, and V&V effects.
* The change-control board evaluates the integrated impact.
* The sponsor or contracting authority approves any commitment beyond delegated thresholds.

A RACI chart that assigns the project manager as sole approver for safety evidence would be defective. A chart that assigns everyone as “consulted” but nobody accountable would also be defective.

**Guided practice — 75 minutes**

Given a fictional medical-device upgrade project:

1. identify the sponsor, project manager, chief engineer, quality lead, supplier lead, operations representative, and technical authority;
2. classify twelve decisions by decision owner and required concurrence;
3. design a weekly/monthly review rhythm;
4. compare the result with the reference governance rationale and correct at least two weaknesses.

**Independent exercises**

* **Foundation:** Create a glossary of 25 project-management and systems-engineering terms, including charter, governance, baseline, work authorization, control account, forecast, variance, reserve, risk, issue, and configuration item.
* **Application:** Draft the shuttle project charter with purpose, objectives, scope, exclusions, lifecycle, assumptions, constraints, acceptance concept, and top risks.
* **Analysis:** Build a governance and decision-rights matrix for at least 15 decisions. Identify three areas where PM and SE responsibilities overlap.
* **Synthesis:** Write a two-page PM–SE Integration Memo defining shared artifacts, meeting rhythm, escalation thresholds, and dispute resolution.
* **Stretch:** Add a responsibility model for sponsor, customer, contractor, suppliers, campus operations, and independent assurance.

**Weekly deliverable specification**

Submit `667_W01_CharterGovernance_v1.0` containing:

* project charter, four pages maximum;
* governance diagram and decision-rights matrix;
* PM–SE responsibility crosswalk;
* management rhythm calendar;
* initial stakeholder, assumption, decision, and risk-log entries;
* configuration-index update and repository tag `W01-submitted`.

**Reduced weekly rubric — 100 points**

| Criterion | Points | Proficient evidence |
|---|---:|---|
| Charter clarity and scope control | 20 | Objectives, boundaries, constraints, and acceptance are coherent |
| Governance and decision rights | 25 | Authority, concurrence, thresholds, and escalation are explicit |
| PM–SE integration | 25 | Shared responsibilities and artifact ownership are workable |
| Management rhythm | 15 | Meetings produce specified evidence and decisions |
| Communication and configuration control | 15 | Artifact is reviewable, versioned, and reproducible |

**Critical failure:** No accountable owner exists for technical-baseline change, risk acceptance, or customer commitment.

**Knowledge check — 10 questions**

1. What does a project charter authorize? 2. How does accountability differ from responsibility? 3. Name two shared PM–SE responsibilities. 4. What is technical authority? 5. Why is an organization chart insufficient as governance? 6. What should a recurring status meeting produce? 7. Who can change a contractual commitment? 8. Why must assumptions be controlled? 9. What is the difference between a baseline and a forecast? 10. Which artifact should link decisions to owners and thresholds?

**Answer guidance**

1. The project and its manager within defined boundaries. 2. Accountability is answerability for the result; responsibility is assigned work. 3. Risk, reviews, interfaces, technical planning, change, and stakeholder decisions. 4. Independent authority over specified technical or assurance decisions. 5. It omits decision rules and evidence. 6. Decisions, actions, forecasts, risks, and escalations. 7. The delegated sponsor/contracting authority. 8. They drive plans and estimates. 9. A baseline is approved reference intent; a forecast is the current expected outcome. 10. The governance or decision-rights matrix.

**Feedback, revision, mastery, and time budget**

Red-team the package as sponsor, chief engineer, contracting lead, and safety authority. Resolve all missing decision rights. Pass at 80%, with no critical failure. Expected effort: 9 hours.

### Week 2 — Opportunity analysis, RFP compliance, and proposal strategy

**Professional context and essential question**

A responsive proposal is not merely persuasive writing. It is an evidence-backed commitment that must satisfy instructions, evaluation criteria, technical need, acquisition constraints, and organizational capability.

**Essential question:** What would make the customer’s requested project both responsive and executable?

**Outcomes**

The learner will be able to:

1. distinguish an opportunity statement, RFP instruction, evaluation factor, SOW, SOO, and performance work statement;
2. identify mandatory requirements, ambiguities, risks, and customer decision drivers;
3. construct a complete compliance matrix;
4. formulate proposal themes that are supported by planned evidence;
5. conduct a documented bid/no-bid assessment;
6. establish the opportunity and proposal baseline `PM-BL0-Opportunity`.

**Prerequisite retrieval — 20 minutes**

From memory, list the charter’s five most important commitments and three unresolved assumptions. Explain which could make a proposal nonresponsive or unexecutable.

**Required readings — approximately 2.5 hours**

* NASA PP&C Handbook §3.6. Focus on acquisition and procurement planning interfaces. [NASA-PPC]
* FAR 35.005 and FAR Subpart 37.6. Focus on work statements, performance outcomes, and statements of objectives. [FAR-WORK] [FAR-PBA]
* Fictional shuttle RFP instructions, evaluation criteria, required data items, and proposal-volume limits.

**Guiding questions**

* What is mandatory even when it has little technical value?
* Which requested commitment cannot be priced or scheduled without clarification?
* How will each proposal claim be supported by evidence rather than aspiration?

**Lesson notes**

Compliance has at least three dimensions: instruction compliance, requirement compliance, and evaluation responsiveness. A technically strong proposal can be rejected if it omits a required volume, violates a page limit, or fails to address an evaluation factor. A compliant proposal can still lose if it offers no credible value or execution evidence.

A compliance matrix should identify the source paragraph, requirement, proposal location, responsible author, evidence, status, and clarification need. “Comply” is not evidence. Evidence might include a schedule milestone, WBS element, staffing commitment, risk-retirement activity, demonstration, or prior capability.

Proposal themes should connect a customer priority to a differentiator and proof. “Safety first” is not a useful theme without a concrete approach, measurable evidence, and management commitment.

**Worked example — ambiguous acceptance requirement**

RFP statement: “The contractor shall demonstrate safe and reliable service before pilot operations.”

Problems: “safe,” “reliable,” and “before” are not operationally defined. A compliant response should not invent acceptance thresholds silently. The proposal should:

1. acknowledge the requirement;
2. identify the planned safety case and reliability evidence;
3. propose measurable acceptance criteria or a joint criteria-definition milestone;
4. record the ambiguity and schedule/cost risk;
5. avoid a fixed-price commitment based on an undefined test burden.

**Guided practice — 75 minutes**

Analyze a two-page fictional RFP excerpt. Build ten compliance rows, identify two ambiguities and one conflict, draft three clarification questions, and create one evidence-backed proposal theme.

**Independent exercises**

* **Foundation:** Classify 20 statements as instruction, evaluation factor, technical requirement, deliverable, constraint, or background.
* **Application:** Build the complete shuttle RFP compliance matrix and proposal outline.
* **Analysis:** Conduct a bid/no-bid assessment using strategic fit, technical feasibility, schedule credibility, financial exposure, resource availability, and contract risk.
* **Synthesis:** Write a three-page Proposal Strategy Memo with customer priorities, competitor assumptions, win themes, evidence plan, questions, exceptions, and executive recommendation.
* **Stretch:** Draft alternative wording for one ambiguous SOW requirement and one outcome-based SOO objective.

**Deliverable and baseline**

Submit `667_W02_ProposalStrategy_v1.0` with the RFP-markup file, compliance matrix, clarification log, proposal outline, theme/evidence table, bid/no-bid analysis, and strategy memo. After correction, tag `PM-BL0-Opportunity`.

**Rubric — 100 points**

| Criterion | Points |
|---|---:|
| Completeness and accuracy of compliance matrix | 30 |
| Customer and evaluation-factor analysis | 20 |
| Executability and risk awareness | 20 |
| Proposal themes and evidence linkage | 15 |
| Bid/no-bid rationale and configuration control | 15 |

**Critical failure:** A mandatory instruction or evaluation factor is omitted, or the proposal makes an unsupported commitment to undefined acceptance criteria.

**Knowledge check**

1. What is the purpose of a compliance matrix? 2. Distinguish SOW and SOO. 3. What makes a proposal theme credible? 4. Is “complies” sufficient evidence? 5. Name two reasons to ask an RFP question. 6. What is a bid/no-bid gate? 7. Can a responsive proposal include assumptions? 8. Why distinguish instruction from evaluation factor? 9. What should happen when requirements conflict? 10. What does `PM-BL0-Opportunity` control?

**Answer guidance**

1. To map every obligation to response and evidence. 2. SOW specifies work; SOO states desired outcomes and permits solution development. 3. Customer relevance, differentiation, and proof. 4. No. 5. Resolve ambiguity or avoid unpriceable risk. 6. A decision whether to commit proposal resources and accept exposure. 7. Yes, if explicit and managed. 8. One controls submission; the other controls scoring. 9. Clarify, record, and avoid silent interpretation. 10. The approved understanding of the opportunity and proposal strategy.

**Revision gate and time budget**

Perform an independent compliance sweep from the last RFP paragraph backward. Close every missing or ambiguous row. Pass at 85% because proposal noncompliance is noncompensable. Expected effort: 9–10 hours.

### Week 3 — WBS, responsibility, work packages, and authorization

**Professional context and essential question**

A project cannot be planned or controlled until scope is decomposed into products and outcomes that can be owned, estimated, scheduled, measured, and changed without double counting.

**Essential question:** How will every unit of work be defined, owned, authorized, and controlled?

**Outcomes**

The learner will be able to:

1. distinguish PBS, WBS, OBS, RAM, control account, work package, planning package, and activity;
2. construct a product-oriented WBS aligned with the technical baseline;
3. write a WBS dictionary with complete scope boundaries and acceptance evidence;
4. establish organizational responsibility and control accounts;
5. define measurable work packages and work-authorization records;
6. reconcile scope once and only once and establish `PM-BL1-Scope`.

**Prerequisite retrieval — 25 minutes**

Draw the EN.645.662 product breakdown from memory. Mark which elements are deliverable products, enabling products, services, and external dependencies. Explain why a task-oriented WBS such as “design–build–test” can conceal product scope.

**Required readings — approximately 3 hours**

* NASA WBS Handbook Chapters 1–4. Focus on product orientation, levels, dictionaries, and common failure modes. [NASA-WBS]
* NASA PP&C Handbook §§2.2, 3.2, and 3.3. Focus on work definition, organization, and integration. [NASA-PPC]
* DOE EVMS guidance on organization, work definition, control accounts, and work authorization. [DOE-EVMS]

**Lesson notes**

The PBS describes the product structure from an engineering viewpoint. The WBS organizes the total authorized project scope for management. They should align, but the WBS may also include project management, system-level integration, assurance, training, and transition products. The OBS identifies organizations. The RAM assigns WBS scope to organizations and identifies control-account ownership.

A work package should have a defined product or outcome, owner, duration, budget, schedule placement, completion criteria, and objective performance-measurement method. “Continue software development” is not a measurable work package. Planning packages are future control-account scope not yet decomposed in detail; they are not hidden contingency.

Work authorization prevents teams from starting attractive but unapproved work. It should reference scope, budget, schedule, owner, assumptions, and authorization date.

**Worked example — defective WBS element**

Defective element: `1.4 Design and Test Vehicles`.

Problems: it combines lifecycle activities, overlaps system test, and does not reveal the delivered vehicle configuration. Improved structure:

* `1.4 Shuttle Vehicle System`
  * `1.4.1 Base vehicle platform`
  * `1.4.2 Automated-driving kit`
  * `1.4.3 Accessibility modifications`
  * `1.4.4 Vehicle integration and acceptance evidence`

Design and test activities are then scheduled against these products and system-level integration scope.

**Guided practice — 90 minutes**

Repair a defective two-level WBS containing duplicated cybersecurity, missing training, task-oriented branches, and supplier scope outside the baseline. Create dictionary entries for two corrected elements and map them to an OBS.

**Independent exercises**

* **Foundation:** Classify 25 items as PBS element, WBS element, activity, organization, control account, work package, planning package, or milestone.
* **Application:** Develop a three-level shuttle WBS and dictionary for all level-2 elements.
* **Analysis:** Crosswalk the WBS to requirements, PBS, interfaces, and RFP deliverables. Identify omissions, overlaps, and external scope.
* **Synthesis:** Create the OBS, RAM, control accounts, six detailed work packages, two planning packages, and work-authorization records.
* **Stretch:** Define an earned-value technique for each detailed work package and explain why percent-complete judgment is or is not acceptable.

**Deliverable and baseline**

Submit `667_W03_ScopeResponsibility_v1.0` containing WBS, dictionary, PBS/WBS crosswalk, OBS, RAM, control-account list, work packages, planning packages, and authorizations. Resolve all reconciliation errors and tag `PM-BL1-Scope`.

**Rubric — 100 points**

| Criterion | Points |
|---|---:|
| Product orientation and total-scope coverage | 25 |
| WBS-dictionary quality and boundaries | 20 |
| Technical-baseline and RFP alignment | 20 |
| Responsibility and control-account design | 20 |
| Work-package measurability and authorization | 15 |

**Critical failure:** Material authorized scope is missing, duplicated, or assigned to no accountable control-account manager.

**Knowledge check**

1. Why should a WBS be product-oriented? 2. What does the WBS dictionary add? 3. What is a control account? 4. How does a RAM differ from an organization chart? 5. What is a planning package? 6. Is management reserve a WBS element? 7. What makes a work package measurable? 8. Why authorize work formally? 9. Can supplier work be outside the WBS? 10. What proves scope is represented once and only once?

**Answer guidance**

1. Products provide stable scope and completion evidence. 2. Boundaries, content, responsibility, and acceptance. 3. A management control point integrating scope, schedule, budget, and responsibility. 4. It maps scope to organizations. 5. Undecomposed future scope within a control account. 6. No. 7. Defined outcome and objective completion method. 8. To prevent unapproved expenditure and scope. 9. No, if it is authorized project scope. 10. Crosswalks, dictionary review, and reconciliation.

**Revision gate and time budget**

Conduct a bottom-up scope walk from every RFP deliverable and technical product into the WBS, then a top-down check for unsupported branches. Pass at 85%, with zero unresolved duplication. Expected effort: 10–11 hours.

---
### Week 4 — Estimating, pricing, budgeting, and reserves

**Professional context and essential question**

A single-point estimate can look precise while concealing immature scope, optimistic assumptions, and unmodeled uncertainty. Project managers must distinguish technical estimate, budget, reserve, fee, and price and understand what each number means.

**Essential question:** What should the project cost, when will resources be needed, and how credible is the estimate?

**Outcomes**

The learner will be able to:

1. distinguish analogous, parametric, engineering build-up, expert-judgment, and learning-curve methods;
2. construct a documented basis of estimate linked to WBS scope and schedule assumptions;
3. develop a time-phased cost estimate and budget;
4. represent uncertainty using ranges, risk drivers, and reserve rationale;
5. distinguish estimate, budget, PMB, management reserve, contingency, fee, and proposal price;
6. cross-check and defend the estimate.

**Prerequisite retrieval — 25 minutes**

Select three WBS elements and state the most appropriate estimating method at their current maturity. Identify one scope ambiguity that would make a cost estimate unreliable.

**Required readings — approximately 3 hours**

* NASA PP&C Handbook §3.5. Focus on cost estimating, budgeting, and integrated planning. [NASA-PPC]
* GAO Cost Guide executive summary and the 12-step estimating process; review estimate characteristics, ground rules, assumptions, methods, sensitivity, uncertainty, documentation, and presentation. [GAO-COST]

**Guiding questions**

* What evidence supports the estimate method and input data?
* Which assumptions drive the largest range?
* Which funds are inside the performance baseline, and which are controlled outside it?

**Lesson notes**

Estimate maturity should match scope and technical maturity. Analogous estimates are fast but require a defensible normalization. Parametric estimates require a valid relationship and applicable data range. Build-up estimates are transparent but can become falsely detailed. Expert judgment should record the expert, reasoning, and uncertainty rather than become an untraceable number.

The basis of estimate records scope, method, data source, assumptions, exclusions, labor categories, rates, quantities, escalation, uncertainty, and estimator. The estimate is not the price. A budget is authorized funding allocated to planned work. The PMB is the time-phased budget against which performance is measured. Management reserve covers unknown-unknowns within project scope and is not distributed to hide overruns. Fee is not project cost.

**Worked example — estimate reconciliation**

For charging-site installation:

* engineering: 1,200 hours × $145/hour = $174,000;
* civil/electrical subcontract: three sites × $310,000 = $930,000;
* equipment: three chargers × $92,000 = $276,000;
* test and commissioning: $118,000;
* direct-cost subtotal: $1,498,000;
* 10% identified-risk allowance within the estimate: $149,800;
* estimate range after uncertainty analysis: $1.48M–$1.86M.

The project should not add the same identified-risk allowance again as management reserve. The BOE must state whether risk treatment is embedded in the estimate, held as contingency, or covered by reserve.

**Guided practice — 90 minutes**

Given an analog dataset for two prior infrastructure projects:

1. normalize for number of sites and current-year labor rates;
2. develop an analogous estimate;
3. construct an independent bottom-up cross-check;
4. reconcile the difference and identify three uncertainty drivers.

**Independent exercises**

* **Foundation:** Match 15 estimate situations to the most suitable estimating method and explain two choices.
* **Application:** Create BOEs for every WBS level-2 element using at least three methods across the project.
* **Analysis:** Develop low, most likely, and high ranges; perform sensitivity on the five largest drivers; compare against the $8.0M target and $8.8M ceiling.
* **Synthesis:** Build the time-phased budget, management-reserve rationale, and proposal-price summary. Explain all differences among cost, budget, PMB, reserve, fee, and price.
* **Stretch:** Run a simple Monte Carlo or scenario simulation and compare its output with the deterministic range.

**Weekly deliverable specification**

Submit `667_W04_CostBudget_v1.0` containing:

* estimate workbook by WBS;
* BOE sheets with sources, units, formulas, assumptions, and uncertainty;
* independent cross-check;
* time-phased budget and cash/resource profile;
* reserve and fee rationale;
* affordability and estimate-credibility memo, four pages maximum;
* updated risk, assumption, and decision logs.

**Rubric — 100 points**

| Criterion | Points |
|---|---:|
| Scope and method traceability | 25 |
| Formula, units, and data integrity | 20 |
| BOE documentation and reproducibility | 20 |
| Uncertainty, sensitivity, and reserve treatment | 20 |
| Affordability interpretation and communication | 15 |

**Critical failure:** Estimate, PMB, reserve, fee, and price are conflated, or formulas contain unexplained hard-coded values that prevent reproduction.

**Knowledge check**

1. When is an analogous estimate credible? 2. What is a BOE? 3. Why can detailed build-up estimates still be weak? 4. What belongs in the PMB? 5. Is management reserve used to erase unfavorable variance? 6. What is the purpose of an independent cross-check? 7. Distinguish cost estimate and price. 8. How should uncertainty be represented? 9. What is a cost driver? 10. Why must the estimate link to schedule?

**Answer guidance**

1. When the analog and normalization are relevant. 2. The documented rationale, data, method, and assumptions supporting an estimate. 3. Detail can rest on immature or unsupported inputs. 4. Authorized time-phased work budget. 5. No. 6. Detect bias and model error. 7. Price includes business/contract elements such as fee. 8. Ranges, drivers, probabilities, scenarios, and reserves. 9. A variable with material effect on cost. 10. Timing drives labor, escalation, cash, and resource demand.

**Revision gate and time budget**

Independently recalculate the five largest cost elements and reconcile the workbook to the WBS and proposal summary. Pass at 80%, with zero unexplained reconciliation differences. Expected effort: 10–11 hours.

### Week 5 — Critical-path networks and integrated scheduling

**Professional context and essential question**

A schedule is a model of execution logic, not a decorated calendar. Missing dependencies, excessive constraints, hidden lags, and unsupported durations can create a date that is visually convincing but analytically meaningless.

**Essential question:** What sequence of work determines completion, and how reliable is the schedule?

**Outcomes**

The learner will be able to:

1. construct a precedence network from WBS scope and lifecycle logic;
2. calculate early/late dates, total float, and critical path;
3. distinguish logical relationships, constraints, calendars, milestones, lags, and resource effects;
4. assess schedule quality and identify invalid or high-risk logic;
5. integrate technical reviews, supplier events, software increments, and acceptance milestones;
6. baseline and independently cross-check an integrated master schedule.

**Prerequisite retrieval — 20 minutes**

For a six-activity network, explain what total float means and why the longest-duration activity is not necessarily the critical path. Identify which WBS elements still lack a measurable completion event.

**Required readings — approximately 3 hours**

* GAO Schedule Guide, *Concepts* and Best Practices 1–5, 7, 9, and 10. Focus on scope capture, sequencing, resources, durations, critical path, float, status, and baseline integrity. [GAO-SCHEDULE]
* NASA PP&C Handbook §3.4. Focus on integrated scheduling and schedule analysis. [NASA-PPC]

**Lesson notes**

The schedule should include all authorized work at the appropriate level, sequence it with valid logic, identify resources and calendars, establish realistic durations, and produce a valid critical path. Milestones represent events, not work. Constraints should represent real external restrictions; they should not be used to force a preferred date.

Total float is the amount an activity can slip without delaying the defined project completion or constrained successor. Negative float signals inconsistency between logic and imposed dates. Near-critical paths deserve management attention because small changes can make them critical.

Percent complete should not be accepted without objective evidence. Status requires actual starts/finishes, remaining duration, forecast dates, and logic updates. A baseline is preserved for comparison; the current schedule is updated separately.

**Worked example — shuttle network**

Use the following simplified network in working days:

| ID | Activity | Duration | Predecessor |
|---|---|---:|---|
| A | Project mobilization | 5 | — |
| B | Requirements and site criteria | 15 | A |
| C | Permit and site survey | 10 | A |
| D | Preliminary integrated design | 20 | B, C |
| E | Long-lead vehicle procurement | 45 | D |
| F | Software increment 1–2 | 30 | B |
| G | Site construction | 25 | D |
| H | System integration | 15 | E, F, G |
| I | Verification and readiness evidence | 20 | H |
| J | Pilot readiness and acceptance | 10 | I |

The longest path is A–B–D–E–H–I–J = 130 days. The path through C reaches D five days earlier; F and G complete before E and therefore have float in this simplified network. The schedule should still assess whether supplier uncertainty makes the E path riskier than the deterministic duration implies.

**Guided practice — 90 minutes**

Calculate early start, early finish, late start, late finish, and float for the network manually or in a spreadsheet. Reproduce it in the scheduling tool. Then introduce a 20-day “finish no later than” constraint and explain why negative float appears.

**Independent exercises**

* **Foundation:** Diagnose 15 schedule defects, including open ends, dangling activities, hard constraints, excessive lags, missing acceptance milestones, and activities longer than two status periods.
* **Application:** Build the full shuttle IMS with at least 80 activities, lifecycle reviews, software increments, supplier milestones, integration events, and acceptance evidence.
* **Analysis:** Identify the critical and two near-critical paths; test a six-week supplier delay and a four-week cybersecurity delay; analyze milestone and resource effects.
* **Synthesis:** Write a Schedule Basis and Quality Report documenting calendars, duration basis, logic rules, constraints, critical path, float, schedule-risk drivers, and recovery options.
* **Stretch:** Cross-check the exported network with a Python or spreadsheet CPM calculation.

**Deliverable**

Submit `667_W05_IMS_v1.0` with native schedule, PDF/Gantt view, network and CSV exports, milestone list, schedule-quality checks, manual/independent CPM cross-check, and four-page schedule narrative.

**Rubric — 100 points**

| Criterion | Points |
|---|---:|
| Scope and milestone completeness | 20 |
| Logic and duration quality | 25 |
| Critical-path and float validity | 25 |
| Risk, resource, and recovery analysis | 15 |
| Reproducibility and configuration control | 15 |

**Critical failure:** The reported critical path cannot be reproduced, or material activities have no predecessor/successor without a documented exception.

**Knowledge check**

1. What determines the critical path? 2. What is total float? 3. Why are hard constraints dangerous? 4. What is an open end? 5. Can a milestone have duration? 6. What is a near-critical path? 7. Why should activities be short enough for status visibility? 8. What does negative float mean? 9. How should supplier milestones appear? 10. What is the difference between baseline and current schedule?

**Answer guidance**

1. The longest valid path through the network to completion. 2. Allowable delay before affecting the governing completion. 3. They can hide logic and create artificial dates. 4.

### Week 6 — Integrated Baseline Review

**Professional context and essential question**

An Integrated Baseline Review is not a ceremonial approval of three separate files. It tests whether scope, schedule, budget, responsibility, risk, resources, and performance-measurement methods form one executable plan.

**Essential question:** Is the technical scope fully planned, resourced, scheduled, budgeted, measured, and owned?

**Outcomes**

The learner will be able to:

1. define the purpose, entry evidence, participants, and decisions of an IBR;
2. reconcile WBS, dictionary, RAM, work packages, schedule, budget, and risks;
3. evaluate control-account planning quality and measurement methods;
4. identify planning risks, undistributed scope, unrealistic phasing, and reserve misuse;
5. formulate review findings with severity, owner, due date, and closure evidence;
6. revise and establish `PM-BL2-Integrated`.

**Prerequisite retrieval — 30 minutes**

Select one control account and demonstrate its complete chain: authorized scope, dictionary, owner, work packages, schedule activities, budget, risks, and performance-measurement method. Any broken link becomes an IBR readiness finding.

**Required readings — approximately 2 hours**

* GAO Cost Guide material on the performance measurement baseline and integrated cost/schedule control. [GAO-COST]
* DOE EVMS guidance on baseline planning and Integrated Baseline Review. [DOE-EVMS]
* Review all Week 3–5 artifacts and current risk/assumption logs.

**Lesson notes**

The IBR asks whether the plan can be executed and objectively measured—not whether every future detail is known. Review at the control-account level. Look for scope not represented in the schedule or budget, budgets without scope, planning packages used to conceal near-term uncertainty, inappropriate measurement methods, optimistic staffing, disconnected risks, and unsupported milestone dates.

A useful finding states the condition, requirement or expectation, consequence, corrective action, owner, due date, and closure evidence. “Schedule needs work” is not actionable. Major findings should prevent baseline approval when they undermine executability or objective measurement.

Baseline approval does not freeze learning. It creates the reference against which authorized changes and performance can be understood.

**Worked example — control-account inconsistency**

Control Account `CA-06 Software/Data Integration` has:

* budget: $1.05M;
* planned duration: Months 2–12;
* four software increments in the proposal;
* schedule containing only one 180-day activity, “Develop software”; and
* measurement method: monthly subjective percent complete.

The budget and proposal imply incremental products, but the schedule and measurement plan cannot show them. Major finding: decompose into increment work packages with acceptance criteria, integration dependencies, and objective completion measures before baseline approval.

**Guided practice — 90 minutes**

Review a defective IBR packet for three control accounts. Identify at least eight findings, classify them as critical/major/minor, and draft closure evidence. Compare with the reference finding set.

**Independent exercises**

* **Foundation:** Build an IBR evidence checklist covering organization, scope, schedule, budget, resources, risk, measurement, change, and configuration.
* **Application:** Prepare one-page control-account summaries for all level-2 WBS elements.
* **Analysis:** Perform reconciliation tests and identify at least ten planning risks or data inconsistencies.
* **Synthesis:** Conduct a 45-minute recorded IBR using project manager, systems engineer, finance/control, software, supplier, and independent-review roles.
* **Stretch:** Develop automated checks for WBS IDs, schedule IDs, budget totals, and work-package authorization status.

**Deliverable and review gate**

Submit `667_W06_IBR_v1.0` containing:

* 12–15 slide IBR briefing;
* control-account summaries;
* integrated trace/reconciliation workbook;
* findings and action log;
* approval recommendation;
* revised scope, schedule, budget, risk, and measurement files;
* configuration index and proposed `PM-BL2-Integrated` tag.

**Rubric — 100 points**

| Criterion | Points |
|---|---:|
| Scope–schedule–budget integration | 30 |
| Control-account and measurement credibility | 20 |
| Risk/resource realism | 15 |
| Finding quality and review judgment | 20 |
| Corrective action and configuration control | 15 |

**Critical failure:** The baseline is approved despite a material gap that prevents objective performance measurement or excludes authorized scope.

**Knowledge check**

1. What is the principal purpose of an IBR? 2. At what management point is planning normally examined? 3. Is an IBR a schedule review only? 4. What should a finding contain? 5. When should approval be withheld? 6. What is undistributed budget? 7. Why are planning packages reviewed? 8. What does baseline approval mean? 9. Can management reserve be assigned to work packages in advance? 10. What proves a finding is closed?

**Answer guidance**

1. Test the executability and measurability of the integrated baseline. 2. Control accounts and their work packages. 3. No. 4. Condition, expectation, impact, action, owner, due date, closure. 5. When major defects undermine the plan. 6. Budget not yet distributed to control accounts for authorized scope. 7. To ensure they are legitimate future scope, not concealment. 8. The plan becomes the controlled performance reference. 9. No. 10. Objective evidence verified by the designated authority.

**Feedback, revision, mastery, and time budget**

All critical and major findings require disposition; critical findings require closure before tagging. Pass the review rubric at 80% and establish `PM-BL2-Integrated`. Expected effort: 10–12 hours.

### Week 7 — Earned value, variance analysis, and forecasting

**Professional context and essential question**

Spending less than planned is not automatically good performance, and spending money is not evidence of accomplishment. Integrated status requires objective progress, actual cost, schedule logic, causal analysis, and a forecast that reflects what has changed.

**Essential question:** What has the project accomplished, what did it cost, and where is it heading?

**Outcomes**

The learner will be able to:

1. calculate and interpret PV, EV, AC, SV, CV, SPI, CPI, percent complete, and percent spent;
2. distinguish schedule status in the network from schedule variance expressed in budget units;
3. select and calculate multiple EAC/ETC forecasts;
4. diagnose root causes rather than repeat numerical symptoms;
5. create an executive dashboard that preserves material bad news;
6. recommend corrective action and distinguish forecast update from baseline change.

**Prerequisite retrieval — 25 minutes**

For BAC $1.0M, PV $400k, EV $300k, and AC $375k, calculate SV, CV, SPI, and CPI. Explain why a positive cash balance does not mean the project is healthy.

**Required readings — approximately 3 hours**

* GAO Cost Guide Chapters 17–18. Focus on EVM analysis, surveillance, and forecast use. [GAO-COST]
* DOE EVM introductory tutorial and selected EVMS guidance on measurement, variance, forecasting, and change control. [DOE-EVM-TUTORIAL] [DOE-EVMS]

**Lesson notes**

Planned value is the time-phased budget for work scheduled. Earned value is the budgeted value of work objectively completed. Actual cost is what that completed and in-process work cost. Therefore:

* `SV = EV − PV`
* `CV = EV − AC`
* `SPI = EV / PV`
* `CPI = EV / AC`

Schedule variance in EVM is expressed in budget units and does not replace network-schedule analysis. SPI may lose meaning late in a project as all planned value approaches BAC. Use milestone and critical-path status alongside EVM.

Common forecasts include `EAC = BAC / CPI` when cost efficiency is expected to continue, and `EAC = AC + (BAC − EV)/(CPI × SPI)` when both cost and schedule inefficiency are expected to affect remaining work. The formula must match the causal story; it is not selected because it gives the preferred answer.

**Worked example — Month 5 status**

Given BAC $7.20M, PV $2.40M, EV $2.04M, and AC $2.55M:

* SV = −$0.36M;
* CV = −$0.51M;
* SPI = 0.85;
* CPI = 0.80;
* percent planned = 33.3%;
* percent earned = 28.3%;
* percent spent = 35.4%.

Cost-only EAC: $7.20M / 0.80 = $9.00M. Combined-efficiency EAC: $2.55M + ($7.20M − $2.04M)/(0.80 × 0.85) ≈ $10.14M. Both exceed the planned cost and the proposal envelope when fee and remaining reserve are considered. The manager must investigate causes before selecting a forecast.

**Guided practice — 90 minutes**

Analyze five control accounts from a provided dataset. Recalculate all measures, identify the two accounts driving the project variance, and write causal statements using condition–cause–impact–action structure.

**Independent exercises**

* **Foundation:** Complete 20 EVM calculations and classify each result as favorable/unfavorable without confusing schedule and cost.
* **Application:** Build the Month 5 EVM workbook, reconcile it to the PMB, and calculate at least three EACs.
* **Analysis:** Integrate EVM with critical-path and milestone status. Explain why one account with favorable CPI may still threaten project completion.
* **Synthesis:** Produce an executive dashboard and four-page status memo with variance thresholds, root causes, forecast range, risks, and corrective-action recommendation.
* **Stretch:** Calculate TCPI for the BAC and for the selected EAC; assess whether the required future efficiency is credible.

**Deliverable**

Submit `667_W07_EVMStatus_v1.0` with controlled workbook, calculation cross-check, variance narratives, forecast range, dashboard, executive memo, and recorded five-minute status briefing.

**Rubric — 100 points**

| Criterion | Points |
|---|---:|
| Calculation accuracy and reconciliation | 25 |
| Objective measurement and data quality | 15 |
| Causal variance analysis | 20 |
| Forecast selection and realism | 20 |
| Executive communication and corrective action | 20 |

**Critical failure:** Expenditure is reported as accomplishment, or an EAC is selected without connection to the identified causes and remaining-work assumptions.

**Knowledge check**

1. What does EV measure? 2. Can SV identify the number of days late? 3. What does CPI below 1.0 mean? 4. Why calculate more than one EAC? 5. What is ETC? 6. What is TCPI? 7. Why can SPI become less useful near completion? 8. Is favorable CV always good news? 9. What is a variance threshold? 10. Does updating an EAC change the baseline?

**Answer guidance**

1. Budgeted value of objectively completed work. 2. No. 3. Work costs more than its budgeted value. 4. Different assumptions create a forecast range. 5. Expected cost to finish remaining work. 6. Required future efficiency to meet a target. 7. Planned value converges to BAC. 8. No; scope may be unperformed or cost not recorded. 9. A rule triggering analysis/escalation. 10. No.

**Revision gate and time budget**

Recalculate the workbook independently, verify every variance narrative against source data, and remove dashboard indicators that obscure material adverse trends. Pass at 85%. Expected effort: 10–11 hours.

### Week 8 — Risk, issues, opportunities, change, configuration, and quality

**Professional context and essential question**

Projects lose control when future uncertainty, present problems, beneficial possibilities, proposed changes, product configuration, and quality escapes are mixed in one undifferentiated log. Each requires a distinct decision process but must remain integrated with the baseline.

**Essential question:** How will the project distinguish uncertainty from current problems and prevent uncontrolled baseline erosion?

**Outcomes**

The learner will be able to:

1. distinguish risk, issue, opportunity, assumption, action, defect, and change request;
2. write actionable risk statements and select handling strategies;
3. integrate risk exposure with schedule, cost, reserve, and decision timing;
4. conduct change impact analysis across technical and management baselines;
5. define configuration identification, control, status accounting, and audit;
6. design a quality plan with prevention, appraisal, nonconformance, and corrective action.

**Prerequisite retrieval — 25 minutes**

Classify ten statements from the current project as risk, issue, opportunity, assumption, action, defect, or proposed change. Explain why “supplier may be late” is insufficient as a risk statement.

**Required readings — approximately 3 hours**

* NASA PP&C Handbook §§3.7–3.8. Focus on risk, configuration, data, and integrated control. [NASA-PPC]
* NASA Risk Management Handbook RIDM and CRM overviews. Focus on decision risk versus continuous risk handling. [NASA-RISK]
* NASA SE Handbook material on configuration management, decision management, and technical assessment. [NASA-SEH]

**Lesson notes**

A risk is an uncertain future event or condition with consequences. An issue exists now. An opportunity is an uncertain beneficial condition requiring action. An assumption is a planning statement accepted as true for now and should have an owner and validation date.

Write risks as cause–event–effect. Example: “Because the battery supplier has not completed cold-weather qualification, the production lot may fail to ship by Month 8, causing vehicle integration to miss the TRR window.” Handling may avoid, control, transfer/share, accept, or research. A mitigation task should appear in scope, schedule, budget, and ownership.

Change control should assess requirement, architecture, interface, safety, V&V, WBS, schedule, cost, risk, resource, contract, and configuration effects before approval. Forecast updates do not require rewriting history; approved baseline changes require traceable authorization.

Quality management focuses on process and product conformance, prevention, objective acceptance, nonconformance control, root cause, and corrective action. It is not the same as “the team worked hard.”

**Worked example — accessible-stop change request**

Change request `CR-07` proposes adding a covered accessible stop after PDR.

Initial estimate: $120k and 20 working days. Integrated analysis finds:

* site design and permit updates;
* new power/data interface;
* accessibility and emergency-egress requirements;
* revised passenger-flow validation;
* construction can be resequenced, reducing net critical-path effect to eight days;
* customer offers $150k additional funding but not schedule relief.

The CCB should not approve based only on available funding. It must assess acceptance value, technical risk, schedule feasibility, contract change, and baseline updates.

**Guided practice — 90 minutes**

Review a packet containing two risks, two current issues, one opportunity, one quality escape, and two change requests. Correct classifications, write response plans, and decide which items require CCB action.

**Independent exercises**

* **Foundation:** Rewrite 15 weak risk statements into cause–event–effect form and identify trigger, owner, and response.
* **Application:** Build integrated risk, issue, opportunity, assumption, change, nonconformance, and action logs for the shuttle project.
* **Analysis:** Evaluate three proposed changes with technical, schedule, cost, risk, resource, contract, and acceptance impacts.
* **Synthesis:** Develop the project Risk/Issue/Opportunity Plan, Change and Configuration Plan, and Quality Plan; conduct a recorded CCB.
* **Stretch:** Create a quantitative risk-adjusted forecast or schedule-risk scenario for the top five risks.

**Deliverable**

Submit `667_W08_IntegratedControls_v1.0` containing controlled plans, logs, CCB agenda and decision record, configuration-item index, status-accounting report, quality metrics, and baseline-impact matrix.

**Rubric — 100 points**

| Criterion | Points |
|---|---:|
| Correct classification and actionable records | 20 |
| Risk integration with project plans | 20 |
| Change-impact completeness and decisions | 25 |
| Configuration integrity | 20 |
| Quality and corrective-action approach | 15 |

**Critical failure:** An approved change is not propagated to affected technical, schedule, cost, risk, or configuration artifacts, or a current issue is hidden as a low-probability risk.

**Knowledge check**

1. Distinguish risk and issue. 2. What is a risk trigger? 3. Name four risk responses. 4. What is configuration status accounting? 5. Does every forecast change require rebaselining? 6. What should a CCB evaluate? 7. What is a nonconformance? 8. How does corrective action differ from correction? 9. Why control assumptions? 10. Where should funded mitigation work appear?

**Answer guidance**

1. Future uncertainty versus present condition. 2. Observable evidence that response or escalation should begin. 3. Avoid, control, transfer/share, accept, research. 4. Recording and reporting configuration status and change history. 5. No. 6. Integrated effects and authority. 7. Failure to meet a specified requirement or standard. 8. Correction fixes the instance; corrective action removes the cause. 9. Invalid assumptions undermine plans. 10. WBS, schedule, budget, owner, and risk record.

**Revision gate and time budget**

Audit one approved change from request through every affected artifact and verify that each high risk has funded/scheduled handling or explicit acceptance. Pass at 85%. Expected effort: 10–11 hours.

---

### Week 9 — Organization, communication, leadership, and conflict

**Professional context and essential question**

Complex technical projects are usually matrixed across organizations that have different incentives, vocabularies, authority, and definitions of success. Communication failure often appears first as technical or schedule failure.

**Essential question:** How will a multidisciplinary team make decisions, surface bad news, and resolve competing interests?

**Outcomes**

The learner will be able to:

1. design a project organization and PMO function suited to the work and authority environment;
2. map stakeholder influence, interest, information needs, and engagement strategy;
3. define a communication and meeting system that supports decisions rather than status theater;
4. diagnose task, process, relationship, resource, priority, and authority conflicts;
5. select negotiation and conflict-resolution approaches;
6. define leadership behaviors and ethical reporting expectations under pressure.

**Prerequisite retrieval — 20 minutes**

Identify three current project tensions and classify whether each concerns technical judgment, resources, priorities, authority, process, or relationships. State which governance mechanism should address each.

**Required readings — approximately 2.5 hours**

* NASA PM Handbook material on project teams, roles, governance, stakeholder engagement, communication, decision authority, and leadership. [NASA-PM-HDBK]
* NASA PP&C Handbook §3.2. Focus on organization and integrated team relationships. [NASA-PPC]

**Lesson notes**

The project organization should match decision and work flow. A PMO may integrate schedule, cost, risk, data, reviews, and reporting, but it should not become a separate reporting bureaucracy disconnected from control-account managers and technical leads.

Communication planning identifies audience, purpose, content, source, cadence, format, owner, confidentiality, and decision/action expected. The same dashboard is rarely appropriate for executives, engineers, suppliers, and operators.

Conflict is not inherently harmful. Task conflict can improve decisions when evidence and decision rules are clear. Relationship conflict, hidden incentives, or unresolved authority conflict can suppress bad news. The project manager should diagnose the conflict before selecting collaboration, compromise, accommodation, competition, or avoidance.

Ethical status reporting requires uncertainty and adverse evidence to be visible. A “green” indicator must not be produced by changing thresholds after performance deteriorates.

**Worked example — software versus safety release conflict**

The software lead proposes deploying Increment 2 to preserve the demonstration date. The safety lead refuses concurrence because hazard-control evidence is incomplete.

Poor response: project manager orders release to protect schedule. Better process:

1. establish the decision authority and release criteria;
2. separate missing evidence from actual unacceptable risk;
3. identify a bounded test environment or feature-limited release;
4. assess schedule and customer effects;
5. document residual risk and required concurrence;
6. escalate if decision thresholds exceed delegated authority.

The goal is not “split the difference” but make the correct integrated decision.

**Guided practice — 75 minutes**

Use stakeholder role cards to conduct a 30-minute readiness meeting with conflicting views. Record interruptions, unanswered questions, hidden assumptions, and decisions. Redesign the agenda and information package.

**Independent exercises**

* **Foundation:** Create a stakeholder power/interest and influence/impact analysis for at least 15 parties.
* **Application:** Build the project organization, PMO functions, communications matrix, report calendar, meeting charters, and escalation protocol.
* **Analysis:** Diagnose three conflict scenarios and compare alternative resolution strategies and likely consequences.
* **Synthesis:** Write a Leadership and Conflict Memo defining team norms, bad-news policy, negotiation process, decision documentation, and response to retaliation or metric manipulation.
* **Stretch:** Conduct two informational interviews with project managers or technical leads and compare their real communication problems with the course model.

**Deliverable**

Submit `667_W09_OrganizationCommunications_v1.0` with organization chart, role descriptions, stakeholder map, communication matrix, meeting/report rhythm, escalation path, decision protocol, conflict analyses, and recorded meeting self-critique.

**Rubric — 100 points**

| Criterion | Points |
|---|---:|
| Organization and authority fit | 20 |
| Stakeholder analysis and engagement | 20 |
| Communication and decision-system design | 25 |
| Conflict diagnosis and resolution | 20 |
| Leadership, ethics, and bad-news visibility | 15 |

**Critical failure:** The plan suppresses technical dissent, lacks a safe escalation route, or permits a project manager to override required independent safety/quality authority without formal risk acceptance.

**Knowledge check**

1. What is the purpose of a PMO? 2. Why is one dashboard insufficient for all stakeholders? 3. Distinguish task and relationship conflict. 4. When is avoidance appropriate? 5. What belongs in a meeting charter? 6. What is stakeholder engagement? 7. Why define escalation thresholds? 8. What is metric gaming? 9. Who owns communication accuracy? 10. What makes dissent constructive?

**Answer guidance**

1. Integrate management information and controls. 2. Audiences need different evidence and decisions. 3. Work-content disagreement versus interpersonal tension. 4. When the issue is trivial, timing is wrong, or authority lies elsewhere—not to hide material problems. 5. Purpose, inputs, attendees, decisions, cadence, outputs. 6. Deliberate interaction to understand and influence outcomes. 7. To avoid delay and ambiguity. 8. Manipulating measures or thresholds to improve appearance. 9. The accountable source and project leadership. 10. Evidence, respect, clear authority, and documented decision rules.

**Revision gate and time budget**

Run the communication plan against a supplier delay, safety disagreement, and executive cost concern. Ensure each reaches the correct decision forum with appropriate evidence. Pass at 80%. Expected effort: 9–10 hours.

---
### Week 10 — Integrated project control under technical and software stress

**Professional context and essential question**

Technical performance, supplier status, software delivery, interfaces, configuration, schedule, and cost often deteriorate together. Treating each problem in a separate meeting can produce local fixes that worsen the whole project.

**Essential question:** How should the manager integrate specifications, interfaces, TPMs, reviews, suppliers, software increments, and agile practices when performance deteriorates?

**Outcomes**

The learner will be able to:

1. integrate technical-performance measures with cost, schedule, risk, and review evidence;
2. diagnose interacting root causes across supplier, interface, software, assurance, and management systems;
3. distinguish agile progress evidence from activity or backlog-volume measures;
4. tailor hybrid planning while preserving system-level commitments and configuration integrity;
5. compare recovery alternatives using cost, schedule, technical, and acceptance effects;
6. prepare an executive decision memo and revised forecast without concealing baseline variance.

**Prerequisite retrieval — 25 minutes**

From the Month 5 dataset, identify one cost symptom, one schedule symptom, one technical symptom, and one organizational symptom. Propose a causal relationship that must be tested rather than assumed.

**Required readings — approximately 3 hours**

* NASA SE Handbook sections on technical assessment, interface management, configuration management, TPMs, and technical reviews. [NASA-SEH]
* GAO Agile Assessment Guide overview and program-management practices. Focus on outcome-based progress, iterative planning, technical debt, and integration with broader governance. [GAO-AGILE]
* Fictional Month 5 crisis packet.

**Lesson notes**

Technical performance measures track parameters that predict whether the design will meet requirements. A trend is more useful than a single point. Thresholds and planned profiles should be established before adverse results appear.

Agile or incremental delivery does not eliminate WBS, interfaces, configuration, acceptance criteria, risk, or integrated forecasting. The management unit may shift from large sequential work packages to increments, features, capabilities, or rolling-wave packages, but completed work must still produce objective, integrated evidence. Story points are team-local planning units and should not be converted mechanically to dollars or cross-team productivity.

Recovery planning should separate immediate containment, root-cause correction, rework, risk retirement, customer decisions, and baseline/forecast consequences. Schedule compression techniques can increase technical and quality risk; adding staff may slow work before it helps.

**Worked example — Month 5 crisis synthesis**

Evidence:

* CPI 0.80 and SPI 0.85;
* battery supplier six weeks late;
* obstacle-detection false stops: 7/hour versus interim threshold 2/hour;
* software backlog burn-down 35% behind plan;
* cybersecurity authorization evidence delayed;
* proposed route-extension change;
* dashboard remains green because teams report subjective percent complete.

Integrated diagnosis:

1. supplier delay threatens the critical integration path;
2. false-stop performance indicates unresolved sensor/algorithm/interface work and may invalidate readiness evidence;
3. software backlog status may contain low-value completed items while integration-critical features remain unfinished;
4. cybersecurity evidence delay blocks operational authorization even if functionality is complete;
5. green reporting reflects defective measurement and governance;
6. route extension should be deferred unless separately funded and shown not to distract from recovery.

A credible recovery may protect one vehicle for early integration, establish a dedicated performance tiger team, freeze noncritical software scope, define increment-level acceptance, bring authorization evidence onto the integrated schedule, and reforecast rather than erase variance.

**Guided practice — 90 minutes**

Build a causal map from 20 crisis facts. Separate symptom, cause, consequence, uncertainty, and proposed action. Test two competing root-cause stories against the evidence.

**Independent exercises**

* **Foundation:** Classify 20 metrics as activity, output, outcome, technical-performance, quality, schedule, cost, or risk indicators.
* **Application:** Update the schedule, EVM forecast, risk/issue logs, TPM dashboard, interface status, software increment plan, and supplier-control plan.
* **Analysis:** Compare at least three recovery strategies, including schedule impact, cost, technical risk, acceptance evidence, staffing, and customer implications.
* **Synthesis:** Write an eight-page maximum Integrated Crisis-Recovery Decision Memo recommending containment, corrective actions, forecast, customer decisions, and governance changes.
* **Stretch:** Develop a probabilistic or scenario-based completion forecast showing best, most likely, and adverse outcomes.

**Deliverable**

Submit `667_W10_CrisisResponse_v1.0` containing original and revised analyses, causal map, recovery alternatives, updated control files, executive dashboard, decision memo, and ten-minute recorded briefing.

**Rubric — 100 points**

| Criterion | Points |
|---|---:|
| Integrated diagnosis and evidence use | 25 |
| Technical/software/supplier-control understanding | 20 |
| Recovery alternatives and tradeoffs | 20 |
| Forecast and baseline integrity | 20 |
| Executive recommendation and communication | 15 |

**Critical failure:** The recovery plan improves reported metrics by changing measurement rules, deleting scope without authorization, or rebaselining past variance away.

**Knowledge check**

1. What is a TPM? 2. Why are trends important? 3. Do story points measure business value? 4. Can agile work exist within an integrated baseline? 5. What is technical debt? 6. Why can adding staff delay recovery? 7. What is containment? 8. How does a forecast differ from a baseline change? 9. What should happen to a noncritical change during crisis recovery? 10. Why integrate authorization evidence into the schedule?

**Answer guidance**

1. A planned technical parameter used to assess progress toward required performance. 2. They reveal direction and margin. 3. No. 4. Yes. 5. Future cost/risk created by expedient technical choices. 6. Onboarding and communication overhead. 7. Immediate action limiting harm while causes are addressed. 8. Forecast updates expectation; baseline change alters approved reference through authority. 9. Usually defer or separately justify it. 10. Because acceptance can be blocked even when development appears complete.

**Revision gate and time budget**

Red-team the recommendation as customer, systems engineer, supplier, finance lead, software lead, and assurance authority. Preserve the first response and document why the revised response is better. Pass at 85%. Expected effort: 11–12 hours.

### Week 11 — Proposal and project-management red-team review

**Professional context and essential question**

A proposal can contain individually strong sections yet remain noncompliant, internally inconsistent, unaffordable, or impossible to execute. The final review must test the integrated commitment rather than polish prose.

**Essential question:** Is the proposal compliant, internally consistent, affordable, executable, and persuasive?

**Outcomes**

The learner will be able to:

1. perform instruction, requirement, evaluation-factor, and evidence compliance reviews;
2. reconcile proposal narrative, WBS, schedule, estimate, price, risks, staffing, and management approach;
3. identify proposal weaknesses from customer, technical, cost, schedule, and contracting perspectives;
4. formulate prioritized review findings and dispositions;
5. assess affordability and realism against the target and ceiling;
6. revise the capstone without introducing uncontrolled inconsistency.

**Prerequisite retrieval — 30 minutes**

Select five high-value proposal claims and identify the exact evidence supporting each. Select five numbers that appear in multiple artifacts and verify that the authoritative source is defined.

**Required reading — approximately 1.5 hours**

* Final fictional RFP, proposal instructions, evaluation factors, capstone rubric, and all current logs/baselines.
* No substantial new external reading; use the review to retrieve and integrate the course.

**Lesson notes**

A red team reviews from the customer’s perspective. It asks whether the response is easy to evaluate, whether claims are supported, whether risks are acknowledged and handled, and whether the organization can execute what it proposes. A management review separately tests internal commitment integrity.

Review sequence:

1. compliance and page/format sweep;
2. evaluation-factor coverage;
3. cross-volume consistency;
4. scope–schedule–cost–resource reconciliation;
5. technical and acceptance evidence;
6. risk and assumption realism;
7. narrative clarity and customer value;
8. final management authorization.

Findings should be prioritized. Critical findings include noncompliance, price above ceiling, unreconciled cost/schedule values, missing required evidence, impossible milestone logic, or unsupported acceptance promises.

**Worked example — persuasive but inconsistent claim**

Proposal executive summary: “Pilot operations will begin in Month 15 with two fully accepted vehicles.”

Schedule: second vehicle delivery in Month 15 and system integration complete in Month 16. Cost volume assumes pilot support begins in Month 14. Technical volume says ORR occurs in Month 16.

The claim is not merely a wording issue. The proposal has incompatible commitments across volumes. The disposition must establish one approved milestone and update every affected artifact.

**Guided practice — 90 minutes**

Review a five-page defective proposal extract containing eight planted inconsistencies. Identify each, classify severity, assign owner, and specify closure evidence.

**Independent exercises**

* **Foundation:** Complete a backward compliance sweep and a number-consistency checklist.
* **Application:** Review every RFP row against the draft proposal and evidence package.
* **Analysis:** Conduct separate customer, technical, cost/schedule, and contract-risk reviews; identify at least 20 findings.
* **Synthesis:** Run a recorded 60-minute proposal review board and create a prioritized corrective-action plan.
* **Stretch:** Ask an external reviewer to score the executive summary and briefing without seeing the detailed appendices; compare their interpretation with the intended message.

**Deliverable and review gate**

Submit `667_W11_ProposalReview_v1.0` containing draft capstone, compliance report, consistency/reconciliation report, review briefing, findings log, dispositions, and revision plan.

**Rubric — 100 points**

| Revision planning and configuration control | 15 |

**Critical failure:** Any unresolved critical finding involving mandatory compliance, price ceiling, baseline reconciliation, acceptance feasibility, or unsupported customer commitment.

**Knowledge check**

1. What is the purpose of a red team? 2. What is cross-volume consistency? 3. Why review numbers from an authoritative source? 4. What makes a finding critical? 5. Is persuasive language enough to support a claim? 6. What is a backward compliance sweep? 7. Who should authorize the final proposal? 8. Why preserve finding dispositions? 9. What is proposal risk? 10. When should submission be stopped?

**Answer guidance**

1. Evaluate the proposal from the customer’s perspective. 2. Narrative and data agree across all volumes. 3. To prevent conflicting copies. 4. It threatens responsiveness, legality, affordability, or executability. 5. No. 6. Checking from the last requirement/instruction backward to catch omissions. 7. Designated organizational authority. 8. They show review and correction history. 9. Exposure created by assumptions, commitments, contract terms, or weak evidence. 10. When critical defects remain unresolved.

**Revision gate and time budget**

Close every critical finding and disposition every major finding before proceeding. Pass at 85%. Expected effort: 10–12 hours.

### Week 12 — Final proposal, baseline defense, and professional retrospective

**Professional context and essential question**

Professional mastery requires more than producing files. The project manager must explain assumptions, reproduce calculations, acknowledge uncertainty, respond to challenge, and state when the plan must change.

**Essential question:** Can the learner defend the project plan and respond credibly to customer and review-board challenge?

**Outcomes**

The learner will be able to:

1. submit a compliant and internally consistent proposal and execution baseline;
2. demonstrate complete traceability from customer need and technical product through authorized work, schedule, budget, ownership, risk, and measurement;
3. defend cost, schedule, EVM, reserve, risk, and recovery judgments;
4. explain governance, leadership, communication, quality, configuration, and agile/hybrid tailoring;
5. respond to oral challenge using evidence and explicitly bounded uncertainty;
6. establish `PM-BL3-Proposal` and prepare the course handoff.

**Prerequisite retrieval — 30 minutes**

Without opening the files, write the project’s target, proposed price, critical path, three largest cost drivers, three highest risks, current forecast range, and strongest proposal theme. Then verify each against the authoritative baseline and correct memory errors.

**Required reading — approximately 1.5 hours**

* Review all CLOs, oral-defense prompts, capstone rubric, current baseline, findings, and NASA PP&C closing guidance on integrated analysis and reporting. [NASA-PPC]

**Lesson notes**

A defense should answer the question asked, show the authoritative evidence, state assumptions, distinguish fact from forecast, and acknowledge limitations. Do not defend every original choice. Strong project management includes changing a weak plan when evidence justifies it.

The final package should be navigable. The executive narrative explains value and decisions; detailed files provide evidence. Every reused number should have one authoritative source. Every risk and assumption should have a current status. The handoff should tell the next course which artifacts are stable, which are educational approximations, and which require technical maturation.

**Worked example — forecast challenge**

Reviewer: “Your current EAC exceeds the original performance baseline. Why should the customer believe the proposal price remains credible?”

Weak answer: “The team will work harder and improve CPI.”

Credible answer structure:

1. acknowledge the variance and identify the authoritative current forecast;
2. explain root causes and which are one-time versus continuing;
3. show corrective actions and schedule/technical evidence;
4. distinguish contract cost, management reserve, fee, and customer price;
5. state whether the proposal must be repriced or scoped differently;
6. identify the decision date and trigger for further action.

**Guided practice — 75 minutes**

Conduct a rapid defense drill using 15 randomly selected questions. Limit initial answers to two minutes, then provide supporting evidence. Record unsupported claims and revise the briefing.

**Independent exercises**

* **Foundation:** Complete every final consistency check and produce a signed verification checklist.
* **Application:** Assemble the three proposal volumes and project-control baseline package.
* **Analysis:** Perform a final uncertainty and decision-trigger review; identify which commitments are robust and which depend on unresolved assumptions.
* **Synthesis:** Deliver the 15–20 slide customer briefing and 20-minute oral defense; write the executive report and retrospective.
* **Stretch:** Present the proposal to an external project manager or systems engineer and incorporate a final lessons-learned note without altering the controlled submitted baseline.

**Final deliverable and baseline**

Submit `667_W12_FinalCapstone_v1.0` containing all outputs specified in the capstone section, final configuration index, signed consistency checklist, oral-defense recording or transcript, final rubric, retrospective, and `667_handoff.md`. Tag `PM-BL3-Proposal` only after all critical checks pass.

**Final weekly rubric — 100 points**

| Criterion | Points |
|---|---:|
| Compliance, integration, and traceability | 25 |
| Cost, schedule, EVM, risk, and control credibility | 25 |
| Governance, leadership, quality, and configuration | 15 |
| Proposal value, clarity, and executive communication | 15 |
| Oral defense, uncertainty, and professional judgment | 20 |

**Critical failure:** The learner cannot reproduce a key calculation, cannot identify the authoritative baseline, conceals a material adverse fact, or makes a customer commitment unsupported by the submitted scope, schedule, cost, or acceptance evidence.

**Knowledge check and oral-defense readiness**

1. Distinguish baseline, budget, forecast, reserve, and price. 2. Show one complete scope-to-performance trace. 3. State the critical and near-critical paths. 4. Explain the selected EAC. 5. Identify the largest unresolved assumption. 6. Explain one rejected change. 7. Identify one technical metric that predicts acceptance risk. 8. Explain how agile software work remains integrated. 9. Identify the most important IBR finding and its closure. 10. State the trigger that would require replanning.

**Answer guidance**

Answers must reference the learner’s controlled project evidence. A satisfactory answer is accurate, concise, reproducible, and explicit about uncertainty; there is no generic answer key for project-specific values.

**Mastery and time budget**

Course completion requires:

* 80% or higher overall;
* 80% or higher on the final capstone and defense;
* no unresolved noncompensable failure;
* closure or formal disposition of all critical review findings;
* complete `PM-BL3-Proposal` and handoff package.

Expected Week 12 effort: 11–13 hours.

#### Weekly solution and instructor-material package

Maintain a separate `00_admin/solutions/` package containing:

* readiness-diagnostic parallel form and scoring guide;
* reference governance and compliance-matrix rationales;
* defective WBS, schedule, EVM, dashboard, risk, and proposal artifacts with annotated corrections;
* CPM network answer files and independent schedule checks;
* estimate and EVM reference calculations with visible formulas;
* IBR role cards, expected findings, and closure examples;
* Month 5 crisis facts, causal hypotheses, and defensible alternative responses;
* weekly knowledge-check answer keys;
* analytic rubrics, critical-failure examples, and mastery-decision records;
* oral-defense role cards and question bank.

Reference materials should be reviewed only after the learner submits the independent attempt. Open-ended project artifacts should use reference rationales and quality criteria rather than a single supposedly correct solution.

### 13. Feedback and self-evaluation plan

The course uses the following feedback mechanisms:

* **Reference calculations** for CPM, cost reconciliation, EVM, forecasting, and selected schedule-quality checks;
* **analytic rubrics** for every major artifact;
* **deliberately defective artifacts** that teach diagnosis before independent construction;
* **trace and reconciliation checks** linking requirements/PBS/WBS/work packages/schedule/budget/responsibility/risk;
* **role-based review boards** representing customer, sponsor, systems engineering, finance, contracting, supplier, software, safety, operations, and independent review;
* **recorded briefings and self-critique**, including identification of unsupported claims, weak visuals, hidden assumptions, and unanswered questions;
* **optional peer review** with contribution and review-quality records;
* **mandatory revision** after the Week 6 IBR, Week 7 EVM review, Week 10 crisis exercise, and Week 11 proposal review.

**Revision scoring**

For artifacts with mandatory revision, 80% of the score assesses the revised technical quality and 20% assesses the quality of the response to feedback: accurate understanding of the finding, appropriate action, preserved audit trail, and explicit closure evidence. Silently deleting or rewriting a problem without disposition does not satisfy revision requirements.

**Weekly management journal**

Maintain `pm_journal.md` with:

* the week's most consequential management decision;
* one assumption that could invalidate the plan;
* one item the project manager should escalate;
* one metric that provides decision value and one that risks becoming performative;
* one PM–SE interface that requires clarification;
* actual time spent and deviation from the study plan.

### 14. Standard course rubric

| Dimension | Exemplary | Proficient | Developing | Insufficient |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Integrated planning and control | Scope, schedule, cost, resources, risk, technical performance and responsibility are fully reconciled and support management action | Major planning elements are integrated with minor gaps | Several crosswalks or control relationships are weak | Plans are disconnected or cannot support control |
| Quantitative correctness and forecast credibility | Calculations are correct, independently checked, causally interpreted and bounded by uncertainty | Calculations are substantially correct and interpretation supports the decision | Errors or weak assumptions reduce confidence | Fundamental CPM, cost or EVM errors invalidate conclusions |
| Technical-management alignment | Management artifacts preserve technical intent, interfaces, evidence, reviews and configuration integrity | Technical and management baselines are generally aligned | Important technical dependencies are not reflected in the plan | Project control is detached from technical accomplishment |
| Decision, risk and change discipline | Decisions, risks, issues, opportunities and changes are explicit, owned, timely and traceable to effects | Core decision and control records are usable | Records are incomplete, reactive or weakly linked | Material changes or risks are hidden or uncontrolled |
| Leadership and stakeholder judgment | Communication, governance, conflict handling and escalation are candid, audience-specific and ethically sound | Management approach is clear and generally appropriate | Communication or responsibility is ambiguous | Reporting is misleading, evasive or operationally unusable |
| Proposal compliance and executability | Proposal is fully compliant, persuasive, affordable and supported by an executable baseline | Proposal is responsive with small omissions | Compliance or executability gaps create material concern | Proposal fails key instructions or makes unsupported commitments |
| Configuration, traceability and reproducibility | Every baseline value and conclusion is traceable, versioned, reconcilable and reproducible | Control is substantially complete | Audit trail or reconciliation has multiple gaps | Baseline state cannot be determined or reproduced |
| Professional communication | Reports and briefings are concise, accurate, decision-oriented and defensible under challenge | Communication is understandable and complete | Excess detail, weak visuals or vague conclusions impede use | Communication obscures status or fails to answer the decision need |

### 15. Critical criteria and mastery gates

A learner cannot pass through point accumulation alone.

**Noncompensable critical criteria**

* the final WBS must represent the authorized technical and project scope without material omissions or duplicate counting;
* every control account and work package must have defined scope, owner, schedule, budget, and objective completion or measurement criteria;
* the integrated schedule must contain usable precedence logic and a defensible critical path; a schedule dominated by unexplained constraints, missing links, or impossible calendars does not pass;
* the cost baseline must reconcile to the estimate, budget and proposal price, with reserves and exclusions clearly distinguished;
* EVM calculations must use consistent PV, EV, AC and BAC definitions; expenditure cannot be substituted for earned value;
* baseline changes, forecast changes, corrective actions and management reserve use must be distinguished and controlled;
* no material technical, safety, acceptance, contractual, cost or schedule commitment may be knowingly hidden or represented as more certain than the evidence supports;
* all critical IBR and proposal-review findings must be dispositioned or explicitly accepted by a named decision authority as residual risk;
* final proposal claims and schedules must trace to the controlled baseline and compliance matrix;
* submitted calculations and evidence must be reproducible.

**Course completion standard**

* at least **80% overall**;
* at least **70%** in each major assessment category;
* at least **80%** on the final capstone;
* all critical criteria satisfied;
* final capstone rated at least **Proficient** for integrated planning and control, quantitative correctness, proposal compliance, and configuration/traceability;
* successful oral defense demonstrating personal command of the calculations, assumptions, risks, decisions, and management strategy.

**Recovery policy**

A learner who fails a critical criterion completes targeted remediation and re-defends the affected baseline. A second attempt must use changed input data or an alternate scenario so that correction demonstrates understanding rather than transcription.

### 16. Capstone specification

**Capstone problem**

Respond as CMSI's project manager to the fictional university RFP for the Autonomous Campus Shuttle Pilot Deployment. Submit a proposal and project-management baseline that are responsive to customer instructions, technically aligned with the inherited system concept, affordable within the stated constraints, executable within 18 months, measurable during execution, and credible under independent review.

**Required inputs**

* fictional RFP, amendments, questions and answers;
* EN.645.662 `BL3-Concept` and handoff note;
* historical analog-project and labor-rate data;
* supplier and permitting assumptions;
* required customer milestones and reporting expectations;
* Month 5 status and crisis datasets;
* all course templates and review findings.

**Required outputs**

1. **Proposal Volume 1 — Executive and management approach**
   * executive summary and customer-value proposition;
   * compliance matrix and list of assumptions, exceptions and clarifications;
   * project objectives, scope, lifecycle, governance and decision rights;
   * organization, key roles, responsibility assignment, leadership and communications approach;
   * review, reporting, stakeholder-engagement and conflict-resolution approach.
2. **Proposal Volume 2 — Technical-project execution approach**
   * technical-baseline inheritance and scope narrative;
   * product-oriented WBS and WBS dictionary;
   * integrated lifecycle, major technical reviews and acceptance events;
   * interface, supplier, technical-performance, quality, configuration and data-management approach;
   * software/agile or hybrid delivery appendix;
   * risk, issue and opportunity-management approach.
3. **Proposal Volume 3 — Cost and schedule**
   * basis of estimate and estimate summary by WBS;
   * cost range, major drivers, uncertainty, exclusions and cross-check;
   * time-phased budget, reserve and pricing summary;
   * integrated master schedule, network export, critical path, key milestones, float and schedule-quality report;
   * affordability and schedule-risk narrative.
4. **Project-control baseline package**
   * OBS, RAM, control accounts, work packages and work-authorization records;
   * performance measurement baseline and earned-value measurement plan;
   * Month 5 EVM analysis, forecast range and corrective-action decision;
   * risk, issue, opportunity, change and configuration logs;
   * technical-performance and interface dashboard design;
   * configuration index and baseline/change history.
5. **Review and communication package**
   * IBR briefing and closed findings;
   * final 15–20 slide customer proposal briefing;
   * 12–15 page project-manager executive report, excluding appendices;
   * 20-minute recorded oral defense or equivalent live review;
   * one-page retrospective and `667_handoff.md`.

**Required consistency checks**

* every RFP instruction and evaluation factor maps to a proposal section and evidence item;
* every relevant EN.645.662 product, architecture and interface element maps to WBS scope or an explicit exclusion;
* WBS, WBS dictionary, OBS, RAM, work packages, schedule, budget and risk records use consistent identifiers;
* the sum of work-package and planning-package budgets reconciles to control-account budgets and the performance measurement baseline;
* the performance measurement baseline, undistributed budget, summary-level planning packages, management reserve, fee and proposal price are not conflated;
* all schedule activities except legitimate start/finish milestones have predecessor and successor logic or an explained exception;
* the reported critical path is reproduced by an independent calculation or tool check;
* EVM measures and forecasts are independently recalculated from the status dataset;
* every material risk has an effect on scope, schedule, cost, technical performance, reserve, contingency or decision timing;
* every approved change shows impact analysis and updates all affected baseline artifacts;
* proposal narrative values match the authoritative cost and schedule files;
* all critical review findings have closure evidence.

**Review format**

Conduct a two-stage final review:

1. **Customer Proposal Review** — sponsor, customer contracting lead, technical evaluator, cost evaluator, operator and safety/accessibility representative assess compliance, value, realism and risk.
2. **Project Baseline Defense** — project executive, systems engineer, finance/project-controls lead, software lead, supplier lead, quality/configuration lead and independent reviewer assess executability and control integrity.

When no external reviewers are available, use the role cards and question bank, record the review, answer each role from evidence, and then perform a written self-critique.

**Oral defense prompts**

1. Which RFP requirement most strongly shaped the management approach, and where is its effect visible in the baseline?
2. Show one complete trace from a system product or interface through WBS, work package, schedule activity, budget, owner, risk and performance measure.
3. Why is the reported critical path valid, and which near-critical path deserves management attention?
4. Which estimate method was used for the three largest cost elements, and why is each method appropriate to maturity and available data?
5. Distinguish cost estimate, budget, performance measurement baseline, management reserve, fee and proposal price in your submission.
6. At Month 5, what are CPI and SPI, what causal story explains them, and which EAC or schedule forecast do you trust most?
7. Which corrective action improves the project rather than merely improving the reported metric?
8. Which risk consumes the most management attention, and how is its handling reflected in schedule, budget, reserves or technical work?
9. Describe one proposed change that should be rejected even though it appears locally beneficial.
10. How does your agile or hybrid software approach remain integrated with system reviews, interfaces, configuration, cost and acceptance evidence?
11. Where could organizational conflict or incentive misalignment distort reporting, and what governance prevents it?
12. Which proposal claim is least certain, how have you represented that uncertainty, and what event would force replanning?
13. What would an independent reviewer most reasonably challenge in your baseline?
14. Which management artifact should EN.645.764 or EN.645.767 inherit first, and what must that later course revise?

### 17. Portfolio and course-exit package

Retain:

* `PM-BL0-Opportunity`, `PM-BL1-Scope`, `PM-BL2-Integrated`, and `PM-BL3-Proposal` tags and configuration indexes;
* readiness diagnostic, recovery work if applicable, and formula cross-checks;
* project charter, governance and PM–SE responsibility records;

* risk, issue, opportunity, change, configuration, quality, interface and TPM controls;
* organization, communications, stakeholder, leadership and conflict-resolution products;
* crisis-response original and revised submissions;
* final proposal, executive report, briefing, oral-defense recording or transcript, rubrics and retrospective;
* `667_handoff.md`.

**Course-exit handoff note**

Create `667_handoff.md` describing:

* authoritative baseline tags and native tool files;
* current project assumptions, reserves, risks and unresolved decisions;
* which management artifacts are reusable without modification;
* which numbers are fictional educational assumptions rather than validated estimates;
* which technical artifacts remain preliminary and must be revised in EN.645.764 or EN.645.767;
* open interfaces between project management and systems engineering;
* recommended next course and the reason it is appropriate.
