# EN.645.662 — Introduction to Systems Engineering

**Credits or equivalent effort:** 3 credits / approximately 120–135 hours
**Nominal duration:** 12 weeks
**Recommended weekly effort:** 8–11 hours
**Curriculum phase:** Phase 0 — Program foundations, readiness, and sequencing
**Course type:** Foundation
**Primary program case:** Autonomous Campus Shuttle Service

### 1. Course purpose and professional context

This course establishes the common language, lifecycle perspective, methods, and professional judgment needed for every later course in the curriculum. It prepares the learner to frame an engineered system as a purposeful whole, distinguish the system of interest from its environment and enabling systems, connect stakeholder needs to requirements and architecture, and understand how technical work is planned, assessed, controlled, integrated, verified, validated, transitioned, operated, and retired.

The course is intentionally broad. It does not attempt to make the learner an advanced requirements engineer, architect, modeler, risk analyst, test engineer, or project manager in 12 weeks. Instead, it introduces the complete systems-engineering landscape and requires the learner to assemble a coherent preliminary system concept. Later courses deepen each part of this baseline.

The source JHU course describes systems engineering as a discipline for developing complex systems and covers system definition, lifecycle models, requirements analysis, functional and physical definition, design validation, technical management tools, trade studies, modeling and simulation, interface management, and a conceptual architecture project. The current syllabus also introduces software systems, systems of systems, enterprise systems, and agile systems engineering as advanced directions. [JHU-662-COURSE] [JHU-662-SYLLABUS]

This self-study course uses the same overall scope but replaces the enrolled course's team structure with a controlled individual project, optional peer review, recorded review briefings, reference rationales, and explicit mastery gates. Completion of this self-study course does **not** confer JHU credit or qualify for the INCOSE Academic Equivalency examination waiver described for successful students in the enrolled JHU course.

### 2. Source description and scope

**Source course description — paraphrased**

The source course introduces fundamental systems-engineering principles and their application to complex-system development. It covers systems and hierarchy, lifecycle models, the systems-engineering method, requirements, functional and physical design, validation, concept and engineering development, post-development activities, and technical-management methods such as risk, configuration management, trade studies, modeling and simulation, and interfaces. Learners develop and present a preliminary conceptual architecture. [JHU-662-COURSE] [JHU-662-SYLLABUS]

**Self-study interpretation**

This course includes:

* system definition, hierarchy, boundaries, environments, and enabling systems;
* lifecycle stages, lifecycle models, tailoring, reviews, and the systems-engineering process framework;
* mission and stakeholder analysis, operational concepts, scenarios, MOEs, MOPs, and TPMs;
* stakeholder needs, system requirements, requirement quality, traceability, and requirements management;
* functional analysis, logical decomposition, preliminary physical architecture, allocation, and interfaces;
* alternatives, decision criteria, trade studies, introductory Analytical Hierarchy Process, and sensitivity checks;
* technical planning, SEMP concepts, WBS/PBS relationships, risk, configuration management, data management, and technical assessment;
* introductory implementation, integration, verification, validation, transition, operations, sustainment, and retirement;
* preliminary awareness of MBSE, software-intensive systems, agile systems engineering, systems of systems, and enterprise systems;
* a controlled, reviewable conceptual systems-engineering baseline.

This course intentionally excludes advanced SysML modeling, detailed cost estimation, advanced probability, simulation implementation, detailed software architecture, detailed test-procedure development, and enterprise or system-of-systems analysis. Those subjects are developed in later courses.

### 3. Relationship to the curriculum

**Builds on**

* no prior systems-engineering course;
* general technical literacy and the ability to read technical guidance;
* basic algebra, spreadsheet use, and structured technical writing;
* the Phase 0 tooling gate, completed before or during Week 1.

**Prepares for**

* EN.645.667 Management of Systems Projects;
* EN.645.631 Introduction to Model Based Systems Engineering;
* EN.605.704 Object-Oriented Analysis and Design;
* EN.645.764 Software Systems Engineering;
* the conceptual-design, design-and-integration, and test-and-evaluation lifecycle chain;
* all later quantitative, digital, system-of-systems, enterprise, and complex-systems courses.

**Artifact continuity**

The course produces the initial controlled baseline for the Autonomous Campus Shuttle Service. Later courses may revise or extend:

* the problem and mission statement;
* system context, system hierarchy, and boundary decisions;
* stakeholder register, needs, operational scenarios, and ConOps;
* MOE/MOP/TPM framework;

**Readiness diagnostic — 60 minutes**

1. **Concept and reasoning check — 15 minutes, 25 points**
   Ten short questions on systems, stakeholders, evidence, verification versus validation, cause versus symptom, and weighted decisions.
2. **System-boundary task — 25 minutes, 40 points**
   Given a public bicycle-share service, identify the system of interest, external actors, enabling systems, lifecycle stages, five interfaces, and two competing boundary choices.
3. **Requirement-quality task — 20 minutes, 35 points**
   Diagnose five defective requirements and rewrite three so they are clearer, singular, feasible, and verifiable.

**Passing standard**

### 6. Essential questions

1. What makes a collection of elements a system rather than merely a list of parts?
2. Where should the system boundary be drawn, and what risks are created by that choice?
3. How can stakeholder value be translated into requirements and architecture without prematurely fixing the solution?
4. What evidence is sufficient at an early lifecycle stage to justify a concept, requirement, interface, or risk decision?
5. How should systems-engineering processes be tailored without omitting necessary thinking?
6. How do technical decisions interact with cost, schedule, organizational responsibility, human performance, and lifecycle consequences?

### 7. Running case, datasets, and problem environment

**Case brief — Autonomous Campus Shuttle Service**

A university intends to deploy a low-speed autonomous shuttle service connecting remote parking, residence halls, laboratories, a medical clinic, and a transit hub. The service must operate on mixed-use campus roads and pedestrian zones, accommodate passengers with mobility limitations, integrate with campus security and emergency response, communicate with a rider application and operations center, recharge and receive maintenance, protect personal and operational data, and continue safe operation during degraded communications, severe weather, construction detours, and component faults.

The university has not decided whether to purchase a turnkey service, integrate vehicles from multiple suppliers, develop a university-operated fleet, or use a mixed approach. Stakeholders disagree about acceptable cost, operating hours, staffing, maximum wait time, accessibility, data retention, emergency behavior, and the boundary between the shuttle system and campus infrastructure.

**Provided materials to be created during full weekly expansion**

* two-page sponsor brief;
* campus operating-area map and route candidates;
* stakeholder profiles and conflicting interview notes;
* initial assumptions and constraints register;
* sample ridership and travel-time data;
* candidate vehicle and service concepts;
* deliberately defective needs, requirements, risk statements, and interface records;
* blank ConOps, requirement, trade-study, risk, interface, V&V, and review templates;
* Mars Climate Orbiter failure-analysis packet for Week 10;
* capstone review checklist and scoring workbook.

**Configuration rules**

Use the following repository structure:

```text
/00_admin
/01_case
/02_stakeholders_conops
/03_requirements
/04_architecture
/05_decisions_risk
/06_realization_vv
/07_reviews
/08_final
```

Use filenames in the form `662_W##_ArtifactName_vM.m.ext`. Establish baselines `BL0-Problem`, `BL1-Needs`, `BL2-Functional`, and `BL3-Concept`. Maintain:

* `decision_log.md`;
* `assumption_log.md`;
* `change_log.md`;
* `configuration_index.csv`;
* a traceability workbook with stable identifiers.

**Alternate case policy**

A learner may substitute another case only when it includes hardware, software, people, procedures, at least five stakeholder groups, at least four external systems, meaningful safety or mission consequences, alternative solution concepts, and lifecycle concerns extending through operation and retirement. The alternate case must be approved by a written self-check against these criteria before Week 2.

### 8. Resource architecture

**Primary free teaching backbone**

* NASA, *Systems Engineering Handbook*, NASA/SP-2016-6105 Rev. 2. Use the exact sections in the weekly reading map rather than reading the handbook cover to cover. [NASA-SEH]
* SEBoK, *Introduction to Systems Engineering* and the linked knowledge areas assigned by week. [SEBOK-INTRO]

**Source-course alignment resources**

* JHU EP course page and current abridged syllabus for EN.645.662. [JHU-662-COURSE] [JHU-662-SYLLABUS]
* Kossiakoff et al., *Systems Engineering Principles and Practice*, 3rd ed., optional paid coherence text used by the source course.
* INCOSE, *Systems Engineering Handbook*, 5th ed., recommended paid professional reference and current state-of-good-practice guide. [INCOSE-SEH5]

**Authoritative specialist guidance**

* NASA Risk Management Handbook, Version 2.0, for risk terminology and process detail used in Week 9. [NASA-RISK]
* NASA Systems Modeling Handbook for Systems Engineering, NASA-HDBK-1009A, optional preview of how later MBSE work formalizes stakeholder, requirements, ConOps, MOE/MOP/TPM, and V&V products. [NASA-MODELING]

**Case and failure-analysis resource**

* NASA Mars Climate Orbiter Mishap Investigation Board Phase I report and lessons-learned summary, used for the Week 10 red-team exercise. [NASA-MCO]

**Resource-use principle**

The NASA handbook is the required open-access backbone. The INCOSE and Kossiakoff books add coherence and professional depth but are not required to complete the self-study course. Any future substitution must preserve coverage of all course outcomes and be recorded in the course maintenance log.

### 9. Tool stack and technical setup

| Tool or environment | Purpose | Required or optional | Setup evidence |
|---|---|:---:|---|
| Git plus local or hosted repository | Configuration, history, baselines, reviewable changes | Required | Repository with initial commit, folders, and tagged `course-start` baseline |
| Markdown editor | Memos, logs, plans, rationale, and reviews | Required | Rendered project charter |
| Spreadsheet software | Requirements, traceability, metrics, AHP, risks, interfaces, and V&V matrices | Required | Workbook with formulas, protected identifier columns, and data validation |

**Setup verification activity**

Create a one-page system sketch, place it under configuration control, revise it once, export it to PDF, record the change, and restore the previous version. Completion is required before the Week 1 independent exercise.

### 10. Instructional and assessment strategy

Each week uses the program learning cycle: retrieval, focused instruction, worked example, guided practice, independent case application, feedback, revision, and baseline update.

**Assessment structure**

| Assessment category | Weight | Purpose |
|---|---:|---|
| Weekly knowledge checks and retrieval practice | 10% | Confirm concepts, distinctions, terminology, and method selection |
| Guided method laboratories | 15% | Build procedural accuracy using bounded examples |
| Independent weekly case applications | 20% | Apply each method to the running case |
| Technical memos and failure-analysis review | 10% | Develop evidence-based technical communication and critique |
| Midcourse functional-baseline review | 15% | Assess integration of Weeks 1–5 and require corrective action |
| Capstone review and revision quality | 5% | Reward effective response to findings rather than first-draft polish alone |
| Final conceptual architecture capstone and oral defense | 25% | Demonstrate integrated, independent mastery |
| **Total** | **100%** |  |

**Self-study scoring note**

Scores are used for diagnostic discipline and mastery decisions, not to represent university credit. Preserve completed rubrics, answer keys, calculations, review recordings, and revision evidence.

When available, use the parallel topics in the INCOSE Systems Engineering Handbook, 5th ed., or Kossiakoff et al., 3rd ed. Record section numbers and notes in `reading_log.md`. The free NASA and SEBoK readings remain sufficient for the required course baseline.

### 11A. Fully developed weekly instructional units

The units below operationalize the reusable weekly template. Each week uses the same controlled case baseline and culminates in a reviewable artifact. The knowledge-check answers are intentionally concise: they confirm core distinctions but do not substitute for the independent case work.

#### Common fictional case data used in worked examples

Unless a week provides different data, use the following planning assumptions for the Autonomous Campus Shuttle Service. These values are educational inputs, not claims about a real campus.

* service area: 5.2 km of mixed-use roads and pedestrian-priority lanes;
* three route candidates: Parking–Transit Hub, Residence–Laboratory, and Transit Hub–Medical Clinic;
* preliminary demand: 420 passenger trips on a typical weekday, with a peak planning demand of 54 passenger trips per hour;
* proposed operating window: 06:30–23:30 on weekdays and 08:00–20:00 on weekends;
* candidate fleet concepts: turnkey contracted service, university-owned single-vendor fleet, and university-integrated multivendor fleet;
* relevant external systems: campus identity service, rider application, operations center, security dispatch, emergency response, electric-power/charging infrastructure, mapping service, weather service, and public-road infrastructure;
* safety assumption: the shuttle must enter or remain in a defined minimal-risk condition after loss of a safety-critical capability;
* accessibility assumption: the service must support independent use by passengers with mobility, visual, hearing, or cognitive-access needs where reasonably practicable;
* preliminary decision horizon: select a concept within six months and begin limited pilot operations within 24 months.

### Week 1 — Systems, systems thinking, and the systems engineer

**Professional context and essential question**

A systems engineer’s first consequential decision is often not a design choice but a framing choice: what counts as the system, what remains external, which lifecycle stages matter, and whose viewpoint is represented. A poorly chosen boundary can hide responsibilities, omit interfaces, or make a requirement appear satisfied when the larger service still fails.

**Essential question:** What is the system of interest, and why does its boundary matter?

**Outcome alignment**

By the end of the week, the learner will be able to:

1. distinguish a system, element, subsystem, enabling system, external system, and system of interest;
2. state the purpose, mission, boundary, environment, hierarchy, and lifecycle of the shuttle service;
3. construct two credible alternative boundaries and explain the responsibilities transferred by each;
4. identify at least eight external interfaces and the stakeholders affected by them;
5. explain the complementary roles of systems engineering, project management, and specialist engineering;
6. place a first controlled problem baseline under configuration management.

**Prerequisite retrieval and readiness check — 25 minutes**

Without consulting the readings, answer:

1. Is a service composed partly of people and procedures still an engineered system? Explain.
2. List three consequences of drawing a system boundary too narrowly.
3. Distinguish a neighboring operational system from an enabling system.
4. Sketch the context of a familiar service using no more than eight boxes.
5. Restore the previous version of the setup-verification sketch from version control.

A learner unable to complete Item 5 pauses and completes the tooling recovery exercise before proceeding.

**Required readings and resources — approximately 2 hours**

* NASA SE Handbook §§1.1–2.1. Read for the definition and purpose of systems engineering, the relationship between technical and project-management work, and the recurring common technical processes. [NASA-SEH]
* SEBoK, *Introduction to Systems Engineering*. Read for alternative definitions, system concepts, and the breadth of the discipline. [SEBOK-INTRO]
* JHU 645.662 course description and learning outcomes. Use them to identify the source course’s expected breadth. [JHU-662-COURSE] [JHU-662-SYLLABUS]

**Guiding questions**

* What is lost when systems engineering is reduced to requirements administration?
* Which elements of the shuttle service create value but might not be delivered as physical equipment?
* Which decisions belong to the systems engineer, and which require joint decisions with project or specialist leads?

**Instructor-style lesson notes**

A system is purposefully organized, has interacting elements, exhibits behavior at the whole-system level, and exists in an environment. The system of interest is selected for a particular engineering purpose; it is not an eternal or uniquely correct boundary. Boundaries allocate responsibility. Moving the charging station inside the shuttle system, for example, makes charging availability and maintenance part of the system design obligation. Leaving it outside creates an external interface and dependency that still must be managed.

Treat people, procedures, data, facilities, policies, and external services as candidate system elements or enabling systems—not as background noise. A hierarchy is also viewpoint-dependent: the vehicle may be a system for its supplier, a subsystem within the shuttle service, and an external system to the campus identity service.

The systems engineer integrates viewpoints and evidence. The project manager controls programmatic commitments and execution. Specialist engineers develop discipline-specific solutions. These roles overlap but are not interchangeable.

**Worked example — boundary choice**

*Problem:* Determine whether the rider mobile application belongs inside the shuttle-service boundary.

*Boundary A: application inside.* The shuttle project owns app requirements, cybersecurity, updates, accessibility, verification, and operational support. Direct control is higher, but development and sustainment scope increase.

*Boundary B: application outside as a campus digital-service dependency.* The project defines an interface contract, service levels, identity and privacy rules, and degraded-operation behavior. Scope is smaller, but service success depends on another organization’s priorities and release schedule.

*Conclusion:* Either boundary can be defensible. The decision record must state the engineering purpose, ownership, interface obligations, lifecycle consequences, and risks. “It is software” is not a valid boundary rationale.

**Guided practice — 60 minutes**

Using a university bicycle-share service:

1. identify the purpose and intended outcomes;
2. draw a context diagram containing the service, users, maintenance, payment/identity, public infrastructure, and regulators;
3. propose one narrow and one broad boundary;
4. highlight three interfaces that change category when the boundary moves;
5. compare your result with the provided reference rationale and record two corrections.

**Independent exercises**

* **Foundation:** Create a 25-term glossary, including system, subsystem, element, system of interest, enabling system, environment, interface, stakeholder, lifecycle, architecture, verification, validation, risk, issue, and baseline.
* **Application:** Produce a context diagram and hierarchy for the shuttle case. Include hardware, software, people, procedures, facilities, data, and external organizations.
* **Analysis:** Develop two alternative boundaries. For each, identify ownership, at least six interfaces, three risks, and two lifecycle consequences.
* **Synthesis:** Write a two-page System Framing Memo recommending a boundary and explaining how it supports the engineering decision to be made.
* **Stretch:** Model the same context in a UML/SysML-capable tool and compare the model’s information structure with the drawing.

**Weekly deliverable specification**

Submit `662_W01_SystemFraming_v1.0` containing:

* two-page memo;
* system purpose and mission statement;
* recommended and alternative boundary views;
* context diagram and two-level hierarchy;
* external-interface inventory;
* glossary;
* first entries in the decision and assumption logs;
* configuration-index update and repository tag `W01-submitted`.

**Reduced weekly rubric — 100 points**

| Criterion | Points | Proficient evidence |
|---|---:|---|
| System purpose, boundary, and hierarchy | 25 | Internally coherent and suited to the decision context |
| External environment and interfaces | 20 | At least eight relevant external interactions with no major category confusion |
| Alternative-boundary analysis | 20 | Responsibilities, risks, and lifecycle effects are explicit |
| Role and lifecycle awareness | 15 | SE, project-management, specialist, and enabling-system roles are distinguished |
| Communication and configuration control | 20 | Reviewable, cited, logged, and reproducible |

**Critical failure:** The diagram omits people/operators or treats an external dependency as irrelevant merely because it is outside the boundary.

**Knowledge check — 10 questions**

1. Why is the system boundary decision-dependent?
2. Give one example of an enabling system for the shuttle.
3. Can the same item be a system in one context and a subsystem in another?
4. What is the difference between purpose and function?
5. Name two nonphysical system elements.
6. What changes when an element moves outside the boundary?
7. Which role normally integrates specialist evidence across the whole system?
8. Why must retirement be considered at concept stage?
9. What does a context diagram show that a product breakdown does not?
10. What configuration evidence proves the submitted artifact is reproducible?

**Answer guidance**

1. It allocates responsibility for a particular decision and lifecycle scope. 2. Charging, maintenance, training, test facilities, or emergency support. 3. Yes. 4. Purpose is why the system exists; functions are what it must do. 5. People, procedures, data, policies, software. 6. It becomes an external dependency/interface rather than disappearing. 7. The systems engineer, jointly with other leads. 8. Disposal, data, support, safety, and cost obligations are often designed in early. 9. External actors, systems, and exchanges. 10. Repository history, source files, configuration index, and tag/hash.

**Feedback, revision, and completion gate**

Run the boundary checklist from three viewpoints: sponsor, operator, and maintainer. Revise any missing stakeholder, interface, or lifecycle concern. Week 1 passes at 80% with no critical failure and a restorable controlled baseline.

**Time budget:** reading 2.0 hr; lesson and notes 1.0 hr; guided practice 1.0 hr; independent exercises 3.5 hr; knowledge check and revision 1.0 hr; total approximately 8.5 hr.

### Week 2 — Lifecycle models, the SE engine, tailoring, and reviews

**Professional context and essential question**

Lifecycle labels do not perform engineering. They organize commitments, evidence, feedback, and decision rights. A lifecycle must be selected and tailored to uncertainty, safety, procurement, technology maturity, and delivery cadence without deleting essential reasoning.

**Essential question:** How should the technical process change across lifecycle stages and project contexts?

**Outcome alignment**

The learner will be able to:

1. distinguish lifecycle stages, lifecycle models, processes, reviews, and baselines;
2. compare sequential, V-model, incremental, evolutionary, spiral, and agile-compatible delivery patterns;
3. map the common technical processes to early concept, development, integration, operation, and retirement;
4. justify a tailored lifecycle for the shuttle case;
5. define review purposes, entry evidence, decision outcomes, and exit actions;
6. explain iteration and recursion in systems engineering.

**Prerequisite retrieval — 20 minutes**

Draw from memory: the shuttle system boundary, three lifecycle stages, and one complete trace from external stakeholder to system responsibility. Explain how the boundary affects who participates in a lifecycle review.

**Required readings — approximately 2.5 hours**

* NASA SE Handbook §§2.2–2.5, §§3.3–3.9, and §§3.11.1–3.11.5. Focus on phase purposes, recurring processes, early cost commitment, and tailoring. [NASA-SEH]
* SEBoK, *Process Concurrency, Iteration, and Recursion*. Focus on why requirements and architecture are not completed in a single pass. [SEBOK-ITERATION]

**Lesson notes**

A lifecycle stage describes where the system is in its existence; a lifecycle model organizes development work; a process describes recurring activities; a review is a decision event; and a baseline is an approved configuration used as a reference. Confusing these categories produces plans such as “we use agile, therefore we do not baseline requirements.” Agile delivery changes cadence and feedback structure, not the need for controlled intent and evidence.

Tailoring should scale rigor and timing to risk. Legitimate tailoring may combine reviews, reduce formality, reuse qualified evidence, or apply processes at different depths. Illegitimate tailoring silently removes analysis because it is inconvenient. A tailoring rationale should state what changes, why, the compensating control, the approver, and the risk accepted.

**Worked example — lifecycle comparison**

Compare two shuttle plans:

*Plan A:* Purchase a mature turnkey service, conduct campus-specific interface and safety assessment, pilot one route, then scale.

*Plan B:* Integrate multivendor vehicles, university-developed operations software, campus charging, and custom accessibility features.

Plan A supports a shorter acquisition/pilot lifecycle with strong supplier evidence review and operational validation. Plan B requires iterative architecture, interface prototypes, incremental integration, and more formal baseline reviews. Applying the same review set and document volume to both plans would ignore risk and acquisition context.

**Guided practice — 75 minutes**

Given three small project profiles—a commercial sensor installation, an experimental robot, and a safety-critical clinical device—select a lifecycle pattern and define one review. For each, identify one process to emphasize and one artifact that can be lighter. Compare with the reference rationale.

**Independent exercises**

* **Foundation:** Create a comparison table for six lifecycle models using uncertainty, feedback speed, baseline timing, integration pattern, and customer involvement.
* **Application:** Build the shuttle lifecycle from concept through retirement. Identify at least six decision gates.
* **Analysis:** Compare turnkey and multivendor concepts. Explain how their review and evidence strategies differ.
* **Synthesis:** Write a Lifecycle Tailoring Memo with selected model, phases/increments, reviews, baselines, entry/exit criteria, and five tailoring decisions.
* **Stretch:** Add a digital-engineering evidence flow showing which artifacts update continuously and which are formally baselined.

**Deliverable**

`662_W02_LifecycleTailoring_v1.0` must include a four-page maximum memo, lifecycle diagram, review map, tailoring table, and update to the decision/risk logs.

**Rubric — 100 points**

| Criterion | Points |
|---|---:|
| Correct distinction among stage, model, process, review, and baseline | 20 |
| Lifecycle fit to uncertainty, acquisition, and risk | 25 |
| Review purpose and evidence logic | 20 |
| Tailoring rationale and compensating controls | 20 |
| Traceability, clarity, and configuration control | 15 |

**Critical failure:** Tailoring removes a safety-, acceptance-, or interface-critical activity without an explicit alternative control.

**Knowledge check**

1. Is the V-model a complete project plan? 2. Why do SE processes recur? 3. What is a baseline? 4. What is a review’s principal output? 5. Name two legitimate tailoring mechanisms. 6. Why can early concept decisions dominate lifecycle cost? 7. Distinguish iteration from recursion. 8. Does incremental delivery eliminate system-level validation? 9. What evidence should enter a concept review? 10. Who approves tailoring?

**Answer guidance**

1. No; it is a lifecycle representation. 2. Learning and decomposition occur across levels and stages. 3. An approved configuration used as a reference. 4. A decision plus findings/actions. 5. Combining reviews, reducing formality, changing cadence, reusing evidence. 6. Architecture and support commitments constrain later options. 7. Iteration repeats/refines; recursion applies processes at successive hierarchy levels. 8. No. 9. Needs, scenarios, alternatives, feasibility, risks, and rationale appropriate to maturity. 10. The designated authority, not the analyst alone.

**Revision gate and time budget**

Red-team the lifecycle as sponsor, safety lead, supplier, and operator. Close all omissions affecting acceptance or lifecycle support. Pass at 80%. Total: approximately 9 hours.

---

### Week 3 — Mission, stakeholders, ConOps, scenarios, and success measures

**Professional context and essential question**

Stakeholders rarely provide a complete or internally consistent specification. Systems engineers must integrate needs across the lifecycle, expose conflict, and describe intended use before translating the problem into technical requirements.

**Essential question:** Whose value defines success, and how will the system be used?

**Outcomes**

The learner will be able to:

1. formulate mission goals and measurable objectives;
2. identify stakeholder classes across acquisition, use, support, regulation, and retirement;
3. elicit, normalize, prioritize, and reconcile an integrated set of needs;
4. construct nominal, degraded, emergency, maintenance, and retirement scenarios;
5. draft a concise ConOps;
6. define preliminary MOEs, MOPs, and TPMs without confusing them.

**Retrieval check**

List ten stakeholders from memory and classify each as direct user, customer/sponsor, developer, operator, maintainer, regulator, affected public, or lifecycle support. Identify one likely conflict.

**Required reading — 2.5 hours**

* NASA SE Handbook §4.1 and Appendix S. Focus on stakeholder expectations, operational concepts, use cases/scenarios, and the annotated ConOps outline. [NASA-SEH]
* SEBoK, *Business or Mission Analysis* and *Stakeholder Needs Definition*. Focus on integrated needs and lifecycle viewpoints. [SEBOK-BMA] [SEBOK-SND]

**Lesson notes**

Needs express stakeholder value and expected capability from an external perspective. They should not be treated as unexamined quotes. The integrated set of needs results from analysis of mission, drivers, constraints, hazards, lifecycle concepts, and conflicts. A need can be legitimate even when another stakeholder opposes it; the conflict must be resolved or carried transparently.

ConOps describes how the system will be employed, supported, and evolved in its intended environment. Operational scenarios are testable stories with actors, preconditions, triggers, flows, off-nominal conditions, and outcomes. MOEs describe mission or operational effectiveness; MOPs describe measurable system performance; TPMs track selected technical parameters against plans during development.

**Worked example — wait-time success measure**

Stakeholder statement: “Students should never wait long.”

Analysis yields:

* Need N-07: Passengers need predictable access to transportation during published service hours.
* MOE: percentage of passenger requests served within an acceptable wait-time target under defined demand conditions.
* Candidate MOP: 95th-percentile wait time during the weekday peak.
* Candidate requirement later: Under the defined peak-demand profile, the service shall achieve a 95th-percentile request-to-boarding time of no more than X minutes.
* TPM during development: predicted peak service capacity versus planned maturity threshold.

The analysis avoids selecting X before demand, fleet, route, and affordability evidence are examined.

**Guided practice**

Normalize eight conflicting stakeholder interview statements. Separate raw statement, interpreted need, rationale, priority, source, conflict, and open question. Write one nominal and one degraded scenario from the resulting set.

**Independent exercises**

* **Foundation:** Build a stakeholder register with at least 15 stakeholder classes and lifecycle role.
* **Application:** Create 20–30 integrated needs with stable IDs, sources, rationale, priority, and conflict status.
* **Analysis:** Write five scenarios: nominal passenger trip, accessibility assistance, loss of communications, medical emergency, and maintenance/return-to-service.
* **Synthesis:** Draft a 4–6 page ConOps and an MOE/MOP/TPM table.
* **Stretch:** Conduct two real or simulated stakeholder interviews and compare the elicited information with the provided profiles.

**Deliverable and baseline**

Submit `662_W03_NeedsConOps_v1.0`; resolve all major findings; tag `BL1-Needs`. Required contents: mission and objectives, stakeholder register, integrated needs, scenario set, ConOps, measures table, conflict/decision log, and trace workbook.

**Rubric — 100 points**

| Criterion | Points |
|---|---:|
| Stakeholder lifecycle coverage | 15 |
| Need quality, integration, and conflict treatment | 25 |
| Scenario realism and off-nominal coverage | 25 |
| ConOps coherence | 20 |
| Measures and traceability | 15 |

**Critical failure:** A mission- or safety-critical stakeholder class is omitted, or a conflict is silently resolved without rationale.

**Knowledge check and answers**

1. Need versus requirement? Need is stakeholder-oriented value/capability; requirement is a design input on the system. 2. Why integrate needs? Raw statements conflict and omit lifecycle analysis. 3. MOE versus MOP? Operational effectiveness versus system performance. 4. TPM purpose? Track a critical technical parameter during development. 5. Why include retirement stakeholders? End-of-life obligations create requirements and risk. 6. What makes a scenario useful? Defined context, actors, trigger, sequence, outcomes, and exceptions. 7. Is ConOps an architecture? No, although it informs architecture. 8. Why document rationale? To preserve meaning and support change decisions. 9. Can one need produce multiple requirements? Yes. 10. Can one requirement support multiple needs? Yes, with traceability.

**Revision and time budget**

Perform a completeness review from passenger, operator, maintainer, safety, cybersecurity/privacy, accessibility, and sponsor viewpoints. Week passes when all critical needs are dispositioned and BL1 is controlled. Approximately 10 hours.

---

### Week 4 — Requirements definition and management

**Professional context and essential question**

Requirements convert an integrated understanding of need into controlled design inputs. Bad requirements do not merely create poor documents; they create ambiguous contracts, weak architecture, untestable claims, and expensive late disputes.

**Essential question:** How can needs be translated into clear, necessary, feasible, traceable, and verifiable requirements?

**Outcomes**

The learner will be able to:

1. distinguish stakeholder needs, system requirements, derived requirements, constraints, interface requirements, and design descriptions;
2. write singular, necessary, feasible, unambiguous, and verifiable requirements;
3. attach rationale, source, owner, priority, criticality, status, allocation, and verification metadata;
4. construct bidirectional traceability from needs to requirements and planned evidence;
5. identify orphans, duplicates, conflicts, unverifiable language, and premature design decisions;
6. establish a requirements-change workflow.

**Readiness check**

Rewrite the following without selecting an unjustified solution: “The shuttle shall use LiDAR to safely detect all obstacles quickly.” Identify at least four defects before rewriting.

**Required reading — 3 hours**

* NASA SE Handbook §4.2, §6.2, Appendices C and D. Focus on technical requirements definition, requirement quality, metadata, management, and the verification matrix. [NASA-SEH]
* SEBoK, *System Requirements Definition* and *Requirements Management*. Focus on transforming needs, attributes, traceability, baselines, and change. [SEBOK-SRD] [SEBOK-RM]

**Lesson notes**

A requirement states a necessary characteristic or behavior of the system at the appropriate level. It should express what the system must do or be, with measurable conditions, while avoiding arbitrary implementation. Design constraints are legitimate when imposed by policy, interoperability, regulation, or higher-level decisions—but their source and rationale must be explicit.

“Verifiable” means evidence can determine conformance. “Valid” in the requirements-analysis sense means the requirement represents the intended need. Traceability supports coverage, change impact, and rationale; it is not merely a hyperlink count.

**Worked example — transforming a need**

Need N-12: Passengers using wheelchairs need to board and alight without physical assistance during normal service.

Candidate requirements:

* SYS-ACC-001: The service shall provide a boarding interface compatible with the defined mobility-device envelope in operating condition OC-NORMAL.
* SYS-ACC-002: The service shall complete the commanded boarding-leveling sequence within 45 seconds under the defined curb-height and grade envelope.
* SYS-ACC-003: The passenger interface shall provide perceivable status and recovery instructions during the boarding sequence.

Each requirement receives source N-12, rationale, verification method, success criterion, owner, priority, criticality, and open assumptions. The numerical values must cite a stakeholder, standard, study, or explicit planning assumption.

**Guided practice**

Audit 12 deliberately defective requirements. Mark defects using a controlled vocabulary, rewrite eight, and assign verification methods. Compare with an annotated solution that explains why several rewrites are acceptable.

**Independent exercises**

* **Foundation:** Classify 30 statements as need, requirement, constraint, design decision, goal, assumption, or verification criterion.
* **Application:** Write 35–50 system requirements covering function, performance, interfaces, environment, safety, security/privacy, accessibility, support, transition, and retirement.
* **Analysis:** Run quality and coverage checks; identify orphans, duplicates, conflicts, and premature solution choices.
* **Synthesis:** Build a traceability and preliminary verification matrix and a one-page requirements-management/change procedure.
* **Stretch:** Implement spreadsheet validation rules and conditional checks for missing attributes and duplicate IDs.

**Deliverable**

`662_W04_RequirementsBaseline_v1.0` includes the controlled requirement set, glossary/data dictionary, trace matrix, verification-method matrix, quality audit, change procedure, and findings disposition.

**Rubric — 100 points**

| Criterion | Points |
|---|---:|
| Requirement correctness and level | 30 |
| Coverage and classification | 20 |
| Metadata and traceability | 20 |
| Verification planning | 20 |
| Change control and communication | 10 |

**Critical failure:** A critical requirement has no source or verification approach; a need is declared satisfied solely because a design feature exists.

**Knowledge check and answers**

1. Need versus requirement? External value/capability versus technical design input. 2. Derived requirement? A requirement created through analysis or design decomposition. 3. Why singular? To avoid partial pass/fail ambiguity. 4. Verification versus validation? Conformance to requirements versus fitness for intended use. 5. Why store rationale? Meaning and change impact. 6. Is “user-friendly” verifiable? Not without defined measures/conditions. 7. Can “shall use GPS” be valid? Yes if a justified constraint; otherwise it may be premature design. 8. What is an orphan requirement? No justified upstream source or downstream disposition. 9. Why bidirectional traceability? Coverage and impact analysis. 10. What initiates change control? A proposed change to an approved baseline.

**Revision gate and workload**

Run automated checks and manually inspect every critical trace. Pass at 80%, with 100% of critical needs covered or explicitly dispositioned. Approximately 10.5 hours.

---

### Week 5 — Functional analysis and logical decomposition

**Professional context and essential question**

Jumping from requirements directly to components hides behavior and leads to architectures organized around familiar parts rather than mission logic. Functional analysis describes what the system must accomplish and how information, energy, material, and control flow before physical allocation.

**Essential question:** What must the system do before deciding what it is made of?

**Outcomes**

The learner will be able to:

1. derive top-level functions from scenarios and requirements;
2. decompose functions to a useful level without confusing function with component;
3. represent sequence, flow, timing, state, control, and off-nominal behavior;
4. trace scenarios and requirements to functions;
5. identify performance budgets and candidate allocation decisions;
6. evaluate functional completeness and cohesion.

**Required reading — 2 hours**

* NASA SE Handbook §4.3 and Appendix F. Focus on logical decomposition and functional, timing, and state analysis. [NASA-SEH]
* Review SEBoK *System Architecture Design Definition* for the relationship among requirements, functions, interfaces, and architecture. [SEBOK-ARCH]

**Lesson notes**

Functions are transformations or services expressed as verb–object phrases, such as “Determine vehicle position,” “Authorize boarding,” or “Manage degraded communications.” A function tree alone is not behavior; sequence, control, states, and flows expose interactions and failure paths. Decomposition stops when a function is sufficiently understood to allocate, analyze, estimate, or verify—not at a universal number of levels.

Logical architecture should remain implementation-neutral enough to preserve alternatives. However, complete neutrality is impossible: constraints and feasible technologies shape the function set. Record these influences rather than pretending they do not exist.

**Worked example — passenger-trip functional thread**

Scenario: A passenger requests a trip, boards, travels, and alights.

Top-level functions:

1. Manage service demand.
2. Plan and dispatch trips.
3. Prepare and authorize boarding.
4. Navigate and control movement.
5. Monitor safety and system health.
6. Communicate status and instructions.
7. Complete trip and restore availability.

The degraded-communications scenario adds local authorization, stored route data, bounded continued operation, escalation, and minimal-risk behavior. Those functions may be missed if only the nominal scenario is analyzed.

**Guided practice**

Create a functional flow for an automated building evacuation-notification system. Add one degraded state and trace five requirements to functions. Compare with reference findings emphasizing missing support and recovery functions.

**Independent exercises**

* **Foundation:** Rewrite 20 noun-based or component-based labels as functions.
* **Application:** Build a three-level functional hierarchy for the shuttle and functional flows for three scenarios.
* **Analysis:** Create a state model for service states such as Out of Service, Available, Boarding, In Transit, Degraded, Minimal-Risk, Emergency, and Maintenance.
* **Synthesis:** Produce a scenario-to-function and requirement-to-function trace matrix; identify at least five candidate performance budgets or allocation decisions.
* **Stretch:** Create an N²-style functional interaction matrix or executable state model.

**Deliverable**

`662_W05_FunctionalArchitecture_v1.0`: functional hierarchy, three behavioral views, state model, flow dictionary, trace matrices, gaps/assumptions list, and change-log update.

**Rubric — 100 points**

| Criterion | Points |
|---|---:|
| Functional completeness and appropriate decomposition | 25 |
| Behavioral, state, timing, and off-nominal reasoning | 25 |
| Traceability to scenarios and requirements | 25 |
| Implementation neutrality and documented constraints | 15 |
| Reviewability/configuration | 10 |

**Critical failure:** A critical scenario has no end-to-end functional path, or physical components are substituted for functions without analysis.

**Knowledge check and answers**

1. Function versus component? What versus what performs it. 2. Why use scenarios? They expose sequence and exceptions. 3. Why model states? Behavior depends on condition/history. 4. What can flow? Information, energy, material, people, control. 5. When stop decomposing? When sufficient for allocation/analysis/verification. 6. Is a function tree behavior? Not by itself. 7. Why trace requirements to functions? Coverage and design rationale. 8. What is a support function? Enables lifecycle operation, maintenance, test, or support. 9. Why include recovery? Safe/mission behavior after faults. 10. Can one function satisfy several requirements? Yes.

**Revision gate and time budget**

Run scenario walkthroughs with a stopwatch and explicit state transitions. Close all missing critical functions before Week 6. Approximately 9.5 hours.

---

### Week 6 — Midcourse Functional Baseline Review

**Professional context and essential question**

A technical review is not a presentation contest. It is a structured decision about maturity, risk, and permission to proceed, based on predeclared criteria and reviewable evidence.

**Essential question:** Is the problem-to-function chain coherent enough to permit concept development?

**Outcomes**

The learner will be able to:

1. define review objectives, entry criteria, decision criteria, and evidence;
2. assemble and index a review package;
3. present the baseline concisely to multiple stakeholder roles;
4. record findings with severity, rationale, owner, due date, and closure evidence;
5. revise the baseline while maintaining configuration and traceability;
6. issue a defensible review decision.

**Required reading — 1.5 hours**

* Review NASA SE Handbook §§4.1–4.4 and Appendix N, *Guidance on Technical Peer Reviews/Inspections*. [NASA-SEH]

**Review entry criteria**

The review cannot start until:

* BL1 is approved and controlled;
* critical needs and requirements are identified;
* all critical needs have a trace disposition;
* the five required scenarios are complete;
* the functional architecture supports each critical scenario;
* known conflicts and assumptions are logged;
* the evidence index resolves to actual controlled files.

**Lesson notes**

Review findings should state the observed condition, required or expected condition, consequence, and closure evidence. “Improve requirements” is not actionable. Use severity levels:

* **Major:** prevents approval or creates unacceptable technical/mission risk;
* **Moderate:** important deficiency that can be corrected under an approved action plan;
* **Minor:** local correction that does not undermine the baseline;
* **Observation:** potential improvement or future concern.

Possible decisions: approve, approve with actions, or reject/recycle. A self-study learner must resist grading their own charisma; the decision rests on evidence and consistency.

**Worked example — finding formulation**

Weak: “Accessibility requirements need work.”

Strong: “Major FBR-06: Need N-12 requires independent wheelchair boarding, but no requirement defines the mobility-device envelope and no functional path addresses boarding recovery after leveling failure. Without these, the functional baseline cannot demonstrate accessibility coverage. Close by defining the envelope source/assumption, adding requirements and recovery behavior, restoring traces, and rerunning the scenario walkthrough.”

**Guided practice**

Score a deliberately inconsistent mini-baseline against eight review criteria. Write three findings and make a decision. Compare with the reference board rationale.

**Independent review exercise**

1. Freeze the candidate baseline and tag `FBR-candidate`.
2. Prepare a ten-slide maximum briefing: decision sought, mission/context, stakeholders/needs, ConOps/scenarios, requirements coverage, functional architecture, critical risks/assumptions, open issues, and recommendation.
3. Conduct a 20-minute recorded review using sponsor, operator, accessibility, safety, maintainer, and project-manager roles.
4. Record all findings before revising anything.
5. Create dispositions and perform impact analysis.
6. Revise artifacts and tag `BL2-Functional` only after closure criteria are satisfied.

**Deliverable**

`662_W06_FBR_Package_v1.0` includes review plan, evidence index, briefing, recording/transcript, completed checklist, findings log, disposition evidence, change-impact analysis, revised baseline, and decision memorandum.

**Rubric — 100 points**

| Criterion | Points |
|---|---:|
| Entry criteria and evidence index | 15 |
| Review analysis and stakeholder challenge | 25 |
| Finding quality and severity | 20 |
| Corrective action and impact analysis | 25 |
| Decision and configuration integrity | 15 |

**Critical failure:** The learner revises evidence before recording findings, hides a major inconsistency, or approves a baseline with an unresolved major finding.

**Knowledge check and answers**

1. Review versus audit? Review supports a technical decision; an audit emphasizes compliance/configuration evidence. 2. What is entry criteria? Conditions required before review. 3. What makes a finding actionable? Condition, expectation, consequence, and closure evidence. 4. Who owns closure? Assigned owner, verified by review authority. 5. Can a baseline be approved with actions? Yes, if risk and authority permit. 6. Why freeze the candidate? Preserve what was reviewed. 7. What is impact analysis? Assessment of change effects across artifacts. 8. Why separate severity from effort? A cheap fix can be mission-critical. 9. What blocks Week 7? Unresolved major FBR findings. 10. What establishes BL2? Approved corrected configuration and tag.

**Mastery gate and time budget**

Approval requires no open major findings, all moderate findings under credible control, and 80% rubric performance. Approximately 8–10 hours, mostly review and revision.

---

### Week 7 — Preliminary physical architecture, allocations, and interfaces

**Professional context and essential question**

Architecture turns the logical definition into interacting solution elements. Early architecture is not detailed design, but it must expose allocation, ownership, interfaces, enabling systems, and integration risk.

**Essential question:** How should functions be allocated, and which interfaces carry the greatest integration risk?

**Outcomes**

The learner will be able to:

1. generate multiple physical or organizational architecture concepts from the functional baseline;
2. allocate functions and performance responsibilities to elements;
3. distinguish internal, external, physical, data, energy, human, organizational, and lifecycle interfaces;
4. define interface ownership, content, constraints, failure behavior, and verification approach;
5. identify architecture contradictions and unallocated functions;
6. explain the relationship among product breakdown, functional architecture, and integration strategy.

**Required reading — 2.5 hours**

* NASA SE Handbook §4.4, §6.3, and Appendix L. Focus on successive refinement, design solution definition, interface management, and interface-requirements documentation. [NASA-SEH]
* SEBoK, *System Architecture Design Definition*. [SEBOK-ARCH]

**Lesson notes**

A physical architecture may contain hardware, software, people, facilities, organizations, data stores, and procedures. Allocation is a design decision with rationale; it is not merely drawing arrows from functions to boxes. Many integration failures originate at interfaces whose semantics, timing, units, ownership, or degraded behavior were assumed rather than controlled.

An interface record should define participants, exchanged item, direction, format/units, performance, timing, environmental conditions, security/safety constraints, ownership, change authority, failure behavior, and verification evidence.

**Worked example — position interface**

Vehicle Navigation receives position-support data from an external mapping/localization service. A weak interface description says “GPS coordinates.” A controlled record defines coordinate reference frame, units, timestamp, uncertainty, update rate, stale-data threshold, loss behavior, message schema, cybersecurity/authentication, ownership, and verification method. Mars Climate Orbiter demonstrates why even a seemingly simple unit assumption can be system-critical.

**Guided practice**

Given a functional baseline for a smart greenhouse, allocate functions across sensors, controllers, actuators, operator, cloud service, and maintenance. Define two interfaces completely and identify one risky organizational interface.

**Independent exercises**

* **Foundation:** Classify 25 candidate interfaces by type and internal/external status.
* **Application:** Create at least three preliminary shuttle architectures corresponding to the candidate fleet/service concepts.
* **Analysis:** Allocate every critical function and requirement; identify multi-allocated, unallocated, overloaded, and high-coupling elements.
* **Synthesis:** Build an interface register with at least 20 entries and detailed control sheets for the five highest-risk interfaces.
* **Stretch:** Create a dependency structure matrix and propose an integration sequence minimizing high-risk coupling.

**Deliverable**

`662_W07_ArchitectureInterfaces_v1.0`: three architecture views, product breakdown, allocation matrix, interface register, five interface sheets, architecture consistency report, and updated risk/decision logs.

**Rubric — 100 points**

| Criterion | Points |
|---|---:|
| Architecture alternatives and rationale | 20 |
| Allocation completeness/consistency | 25 |
| Interface identification and definition | 30 |
| Integration and lifecycle awareness | 15 |
| Configuration and communication | 10 |

**Critical failure:** A critical function is unallocated, or a safety-critical interface lacks ownership and failure behavior.

**Knowledge check and answers**

1. Logical versus physical architecture? What behavior versus solution elements/relationships. 2. Allocation? Assignment of responsibility/performance to elements. 3. Why control external interfaces? They determine dependencies and acceptance. 4. What is interface ownership? Authority for definition and change. 5. Why specify units and reference frames? Prevent semantic mismatch. 6. Human interface? Interaction between people and system elements. 7. Organizational interface? Responsibility/information exchange across organizations. 8. Can one function be distributed? Yes. 9. What is an enabling element? Supports development/operation rather than direct mission output. 10. Why link interfaces to verification? To prove compatibility and behavior.

**Revision and time budget**

Run allocation and interface audits. Any critical unallocated function or ownerless critical interface blocks Week 8. Approximately 10 hours.

---

### Week 8 — Alternative concepts, trade studies, AHP, and sensitivity

**Professional context and essential question**

Decision methods structure judgment; they do not manufacture objectivity. A trade study must expose objectives, assumptions, uncertainty, value judgments, data quality, and the conditions under which the recommendation changes.

**Essential question:** Which concept is preferred, and under what assumptions would the decision change?

**Outcomes**

The learner will be able to:

1. formulate a decision statement and objectives hierarchy;
2. define nonoverlapping criteria and measurable value scales;
3. generate genuinely distinct alternatives;
4. apply a weighted model and introductory AHP pairwise weighting;
5. check pairwise consistency and reproduce calculations;
6. perform one-way, scenario, and threshold sensitivity analyses;
7. write a transparent decision record.

**Required reading — 2.5 hours**

* NASA SE Handbook §2.5 and §6.8. Focus on cost-effectiveness, decision framing, alternatives, criteria, uncertainty, and records. [NASA-SEH]
* Optional: review the decision-analysis figures and decision-report information listed in the handbook tables of figures/tables. [NASA-SEH]

**Lesson notes**

Begin with the decision and authority, not with a spreadsheet. Separate mandatory constraints from value criteria. Avoid double-counting, such as scoring both “availability” and several near-identical availability proxies. Scales must define what scores mean. Pairwise comparisons are useful for eliciting relative importance but can be inconsistent; the consistency result is a diagnostic, not proof that the judgments are correct.

Sensitivity analysis asks whether the decision is robust. A preferred concept that changes under a small plausible weight or performance shift should be reported as fragile, not confidently “best.”

**Worked example — simplified weighted decision**

Criteria and weights: safety assurance 0.30, service effectiveness 0.25, 10-year affordability 0.20, integration risk 0.15, adaptability 0.10.

Alternatives are scored on documented 0–100 value scales. Suppose Turnkey = 82, University Single-Vendor = 78, Multivendor Integration = 73. If Turnkey’s affordability estimate worsens by 20 points or adaptability weight rises above a calculated threshold, the recommendation may change. The decision record therefore recommends Turnkey for the pilot while preserving an exit strategy and interface rights.

**Guided practice**

Complete a three-alternative emergency-communications decision. Build a 3×3 pairwise matrix, normalize it, calculate weights, and test a changed judgment. Compare with a formula-checked workbook.

**Independent exercises**

* **Foundation:** Diagnose ten trade-study defects, including hidden constraints, overlapping criteria, arbitrary scales, and missing uncertainty.
* **Application:** Build an objectives hierarchy and at least five criteria with value scales for the shuttle concepts.
* **Analysis:** Perform AHP weighting, reciprocity/consistency checks, weighted scoring, and data-quality ratings.
* **Synthesis:** Conduct sensitivity and scenario analysis; recommend a concept and state decision conditions, residual uncertainty, and dissenting stakeholder views.
* **Stretch:** Implement Monte Carlo uncertainty propagation or Pareto visualization without replacing the required transparent base model.

**Deliverable**

`662_W08_TradeStudy_v1.0`: decision frame, authority/stakeholders, alternatives, criteria/value scales, source data, AHP and weighted calculations, consistency check, sensitivity results, recommendation, signed decision record, and three-minute recorded defense.

**Rubric — 100 points**

| Criterion | Points |
|---|---:|
| Decision framing and alternatives | 20 |
| Criteria, scales, and evidence | 25 |
| Calculation correctness/reproducibility | 20 |
| Uncertainty and sensitivity | 25 |
| Recommendation and decision record | 10 |

**Critical failure:** The recommended alternative is not reproducible from the submitted data/formulas or mandatory constraints are treated as compensable preferences.

**Knowledge check and answers**

1. Constraint versus criterion? Pass/fail obligation versus preference/value dimension. 2. Why value scales? Translate performance into decision value consistently. 3. Double-counting? Multiple criteria reward the same underlying effect. 4. AHP purpose? Structure pairwise judgments to derive relative weights. 5. Does consistency prove correctness? No. 6. Sensitivity threshold? Point where recommendation changes. 7. Why include data quality? Weak evidence affects confidence. 8. What is decision authority? Person/body empowered to choose. 9. Why preserve dissent? It records unresolved value/risk concerns. 10. What is a robust decision? Preferred across plausible assumptions/scenarios.

**Revision and time budget**

Have a second person or a separate clean worksheet reproduce the calculations. Correct any unreproducible result. Approximately 10 hours.

### Week 9 — Technical management and evidence control

**Professional context and essential question**

Systems engineering is not only product definition. The technical effort must be planned, measured, risk-informed, configured, documented, and assessed so that decisions remain trustworthy while the system changes.

**Essential question:** How will the technical effort be planned, measured, controlled, and kept coherent?

**Outcomes**

The learner will be able to:

1. draft a lightweight SEMP matched to the project and lifecycle;
2. distinguish product, work, organization, and schedule structures;
3. formulate risks using cause–event–consequence logic and distinguish risk, issue, assumption, and opportunity;
4. establish configuration identification, control, status accounting, and audit practices;
5. define technical-data responsibilities and access;
6. select TPMs and review metrics tied to decisions and thresholds;
7. integrate management practices with the selected architecture and lifecycle.

**Required reading — 3 hours**

* NASA SE Handbook §§6.1 and 6.4–6.7; Appendices J and M. Focus on technical planning, risk, configuration, data, assessment, SEMP content, and configuration-management planning. [NASA-SEH]
* NASA Risk Management Handbook executive overview. [NASA-RISK]

**Lesson notes**

A SEMP is the project’s technical operating agreement. It should identify processes, organization, products, reviews, decision authorities, measures, and tailoring—not repeat generic textbook prose. A PBS describes product structure; a WBS organizes authorized project work and may include enabling products and management work. They should be related but not assumed identical.

Risk statement form: Given a cause/condition, there is a possibility that an uncertain event will occur, resulting in a consequence. An issue has already occurred. An assumption is treated as true for planning but requires validation or management. An opportunity is an uncertain beneficial event.

Configuration management preserves identity and integrity: what the product/baseline is, how changes are evaluated and approved, what status exists, and whether the configuration matches records.

**Worked example — risk and TPM**

Poor risk: “Bad weather may be a problem.”

Improved: “Given limited perception performance data in heavy rain and standing water, there is a possibility that the shuttle will enter minimal-risk condition more frequently than planned during wet-weather operations, resulting in service unavailability and unsafe passenger transfer exposure.”

Mitigation: collect representative data, define operating envelope, adjust route drainage assumptions, and validate fallback operations. Trigger: forecast rain rate or field-observed intervention threshold. Related TPM: predicted percentage of operating hours supported within the validated environmental envelope.

**Guided practice**

Classify 20 statements as risk, issue, assumption, opportunity, requirement, or action. Rewrite six risk statements and define owner, mitigation, contingency, trigger, and retirement criterion.

**Independent exercises**

* **Foundation:** Build a PBS and a WBS for a small provided system; explain five differences.
* **Application:** Draft the shuttle SEMP outline and RACI-style technical responsibility map.
* **Analysis:** Create a 15–20 item risk/opportunity register and identify architecture, requirement, schedule, and verification impacts.
* **Synthesis:** Establish the configuration index/change workflow, technical-data plan, five TPMs, thresholds, reporting cadence, and assessment dashboard.
* **Stretch:** Conduct a configuration audit by checking a random sample of ten trace links and file references.

**Deliverable**

`662_W09_TechnicalManagement_v1.0`: SEMP outline, PBS/WBS crosswalk, responsibility map, risk/opportunity register, CM plan/index, data plan, TPM definitions, assessment dashboard, and audit record.

**Rubric — 100 points**

| Criterion | Points |
|---|---:|
| Technical planning and tailoring | 20 |
| Risk/opportunity formulation and response | 25 |
| Configuration/data integrity | 25 |
| Measures and technical assessment | 20 |
| Integration and communication | 10 |

**Critical failure:** A high risk has no owner/response, or the authoritative baseline cannot be identified and reproduced.

**Knowledge check and answers**

1. SEMP purpose? Define how technical work is performed and governed. 2. PBS versus WBS? Product structure versus work structure. 3. Risk versus issue? Uncertain future event versus occurred condition. 4. Four CM functions? Identification, control, status accounting, audit. 5. Data management purpose? Ensure needed technical data is defined, available, protected, retained, and authoritative. 6. TPM? Tracked critical technical parameter. 7. Trigger? Observable condition initiating response. 8. Residual risk? Risk remaining after response. 9. Why audit traces? Confirm recorded configuration matches actual evidence. 10. Can an assumption become a risk? Yes, if uncertainty and consequence are material.

**Revision and time budget**

Perform the CM audit and independently rescore all high risks. Week passes only if the baseline is reproducible and every high risk has explicit treatment. Approximately 10 hours.

---

### Week 10 — Complex failure analysis and red-team review

**Professional context and essential question**

Catastrophic failures often emerge from interacting technical, organizational, interface, verification, and communication weaknesses rather than a single exotic component defect. Failure analysis should identify failed controls and systemic conditions, not stop at the last human action.

**Essential question:** How can apparently small interface and process failures defeat an otherwise capable system?

**Outcomes**

The learner will be able to:

1. distinguish proximate event, root cause, contributing conditions, and failed controls;
2. construct a causal map across technical and management domains;
3. analyze requirements, interfaces, configuration, test evidence, reviews, and organizational communication as interacting controls;
4. derive corrective and preventive actions tied to the failure mechanism;
5. red-team the shuttle baseline from six stakeholder viewpoints;
6. revise at least three artifacts based on systemic findings.

**Required reading — 2.5 hours**

* Mars Climate Orbiter Mishap Investigation Board Phase I report: executive summary, root cause, contributing causes, and recommendations; use the official NASA lesson summary as the entry point. [NASA-MCO]
* Revisit NASA SE Handbook §§6.2–6.6. [NASA-SEH]

**Lesson notes**

Avoid “root cause” narratives that blame one person and ignore why the system permitted the action to propagate. Analyze barriers: requirement clarity, interface control, units/semantics, peer review, independent verification, test realism, configuration, anomaly response, staffing, schedule pressure, and communication.

Corrective action fixes the observed condition; preventive action changes the system of work to reduce recurrence. Recommendations must have owners, completion evidence, and verification of effectiveness.

**Worked example — unit mismatch control chain**

A supplier provides an impulse quantity in one unit while receiving software interprets another. The proximate mechanism is numerical mismatch. Systemic analysis asks: Was the unit in the interface requirement? Was the interface under configuration control? Did tests include end-to-end realistic data? Did independent analysis compare predicted and observed trajectory? Were anomalies escalated? Were responsibilities clear? A unit conversion patch alone would not close the systemic risk.

**Guided practice**

Analyze a fictional medication-pump overdose caused by a concentration/unit mismatch. Build a causal map and propose controls at requirement, interface, architecture, verification, operations, and governance levels.

**Independent exercises**

* **Foundation:** Extract the Mars Climate Orbiter proximate cause, root cause, at least five contributing conditions, and recommendations.
* **Application:** Construct a causal map linking technical, process, organizational, and evidence failures.
* **Analysis:** Map each failed control to the relevant SE process and identify which project evidence should have exposed the problem.
* **Synthesis:** Red-team the shuttle baseline from operator, maintainer, safety, cybersecurity/privacy, supplier/integrator, and accessibility viewpoints. Write at least one major or moderate finding per role where justified.
* **Stretch:** Develop leading indicators that could detect similar control degradation before failure.

**Deliverable**

`662_W10_FailureRedTeam_v1.0`: 4–6 page failure-analysis memo, causal map, failed-control matrix, corrective/preventive actions, shuttle red-team findings, impact analysis, and revised requirements/interface/risk or verification artifacts.

**Rubric — 100 points**

| Criterion | Points |
|---|---:|
| Accurate use of source evidence | 20 |
| Causal/systemic analysis | 30 |
| Failed-control and SE-process mapping | 20 |
| Corrective/preventive action quality | 15 |
| Shuttle red-team impact and revisions | 15 |

**Critical failure:** The analysis invents unsupported facts, attributes the failure solely to individual negligence, or proposes actions unrelated to the causal mechanism.

**Knowledge check and answers**

1. Proximate cause? Immediate mechanism/event. 2. Contributing condition? Factor that increased likelihood or consequence. 3. Failed control? Intended barrier that was absent/ineffective. 4. Corrective versus preventive? Fix observed condition versus reduce recurrence systemically. 5. Why use source evidence? Avoid folklore and hindsight invention. 6. What is normalization of deviance? Gradual acceptance of abnormal performance. 7. Why realistic end-to-end test? Component tests may miss semantic/interface mismatch. 8. Why analyze organization? Decisions, authority, staffing, and communication shape technical outcomes. 9. What closes an action? Evidence the action was completed and effective. 10. Why red-team your own baseline? Expose assumptions and blind spots before commitment.

**Revision and time budget**

Compare the memo to the official findings and mark every inference. Revise unsupported claims. Close or disposition shuttle findings before Week 11. Approximately 9.5 hours.

---

### Week 11 — Product realization, integration, V&V, transition, and Concept Review

**Professional context and essential question**

A concept is not credible merely because its architecture appears plausible. The team must explain how products will be implemented or acquired, integrated, verified, validated in representative use, transitioned, operated, sustained, and eventually retired.

**Essential question:** What evidence will show that the selected concept can be realized and accepted?

**Outcomes**

The learner will be able to:

1. distinguish implementation, integration, verification, validation, qualification, acceptance, certification, and transition;
2. construct a risk-informed integration sequence with entry and exit criteria;
3. select verification methods and levels for requirements;
4. define validation scenarios tied to stakeholder needs and intended environments;
5. identify enabling products, facilities, simulators, data, personnel, and approvals;
6. prepare and conduct a formal Concept Review with dispositioned findings.

**Required reading — 3 hours**

* NASA SE Handbook §§2.4 and 5.1–5.5; Appendices H, I, D, and E. Focus on product realization, integration, verification, validation, transition, and planning matrices. [NASA-SEH]
* SEBoK, *System Validation*. [SEBOK-VALIDATION]

**Lesson notes**

Verification asks whether the product conforms to specified requirements. Validation asks whether the resulting system satisfies stakeholder needs in intended use. The activities can use similar methods, but their questions, reference bases, and environments differ.

Integration order should reduce uncertainty and expose high-risk interfaces early. Entry and exit criteria prevent assemblies from becoming uncontrolled debugging events. Transition includes training, facilities, data migration, operational procedures, support, acceptance, and handover—not only delivery of equipment.

**Worked example — emergency stop**

Verification evidence may show that, under specified speed, grade, load, and surface conditions, the shuttle transitions to the defined minimal-risk condition within the stopping-distance requirement. Validation evidence may place representative operators, passengers, emergency responders, and campus traffic in a realistic scenario to determine whether the emergency behavior, communications, accessibility, and recovery procedures satisfy the operational need without creating new hazards.

**Guided practice**

For a small unmanned inspection system, classify 20 activities as implementation, integration, verification, validation, qualification, certification, acceptance, or transition. Build one integration step with entry/exit criteria and one complete requirement-evidence record.

**Independent exercises**

* **Foundation:** Assign verification methods—analysis, inspection, demonstration, or test—to 25 requirements and justify five ambiguous choices.
* **Application:** Build the shuttle integration sequence and identify stubs, simulators, facilities, test data, and interface readiness criteria.
* **Analysis:** Complete the requirement verification matrix and stakeholder-need validation matrix for all critical items.
* **Synthesis:** Draft transition, pilot operations, training, sustainment, update, incident-response, and retirement concepts.
* **Review:** Freeze `ConceptReview-candidate`, prepare the evidence index and 15-minute briefing, conduct the Concept Review, and issue findings/dispositions.

**Deliverable**

`662_W11_ConceptReview_v1.0`: implementation/acquisition concept, integration plan, V&V matrices, validation scenarios, transition/sustainment/retirement concept, review plan, evidence index, briefing, findings, and corrective-action plan.

**Rubric — 100 points**

| Criterion | Points |
|---|---:|
| Realization and integration logic | 20 |
| Verification completeness and appropriateness | 20 |
| Validation and intended-use realism | 20 |
| Transition/lifecycle support | 15 |
| Review evidence and finding quality | 25 |

**Critical failure:** Verification and validation are treated as synonyms, or a critical requirement/need lacks planned evidence.

**Knowledge check and answers**

1. Verification reference? Requirements. 2. Validation reference? Stakeholder needs/intended use. 3. Integration entry criterion? Condition required before combining/testing elements. 4. Why use simulators/stubs? Provide unavailable elements and isolate behavior. 5. Qualification? Evidence a design/type meets defined conditions. 6. Acceptance? Customer/authority decision to receive/use. 7. Certification? Authorized body’s formal determination against criteria. 8. Transition includes? Installation, data, training, procedures, support, handover. 9. Why validate off-nominal scenarios? Stakeholder success includes degraded/emergency use. 10. What must happen to review findings? Record, own, disposition, and close/accept explicitly.

**Review gate and time budget**

All major Concept Review findings must close before final submission. Moderate findings require approved disposition and residual-risk statement. Approximately 11 hours.

### Week 12 — Final synthesis, oral defense, and professional roadmap

**Professional context and essential question**

Professional systems engineering is demonstrated through coherent evidence and defensible judgment, not the number of artifacts produced. The final week establishes an authoritative concept baseline, tests the learner’s ability to explain it, and identifies which competencies require deeper study.

**Essential question:** Is the concept coherent, traceable, defensible, and ready for deeper engineering?

**Outcomes**

The learner will be able to:

1. integrate the complete preliminary conceptual architecture baseline;
2. run automated and manual consistency checks across artifacts;
3. communicate a recommendation to executive and technical audiences;
4. defend assumptions, boundaries, requirements, architecture, trade, risk, and evidence decisions under questioning;
5. identify limitations and appropriate next-course handoff;
6. preserve the final configuration and revision history.

**Required reading — 1.5 hours**

* NASA SE Handbook §§2.6–2.7 and Appendix T. Focus on human-systems integration, professional competency, and operational-phase engineering. [NASA-SEH]
* Review the JHU 645.662 advanced-topic list and the optional NASA Systems Modeling Handbook overview to identify later-course pathways. [JHU-662-SYLLABUS] [NASA-MODELING]

**Lesson notes**

Synthesis means more than assembling files. Verify that every critical need is dispositioned; every critical requirement has source, rationale, allocation, and evidence plan; every critical function is allocated; interfaces are owned; decisions reproduce; high risks influence plans; and review findings are closed or accepted.

The oral defense tests personal understanding. A polished artifact does not pass if the learner cannot explain why it exists, which evidence supports it, and how it would change under different assumptions.

**Worked example — end-to-end trace**

Mission objective → stakeholder need N-12 for independent boarding → accessibility requirements SYS-ACC-001/002/003 → functions Prepare Boarding, Level Interface, Communicate Status, Recover Boarding Fault → allocated vehicle doorway/leveling subsystem, passenger interface, operations support, and procedure → controlled physical/data/human interfaces → verification tests/inspection and operational validation scenario → residual risk and pilot monitoring measure.

Any broken link becomes a finding before final submission.

**Guided practice**

Use a supplied ten-item consistency defect list on a miniature baseline. Detect orphan requirement, unallocated function, inconsistent units, missing interface owner, stale figure, unreproduced score, open major finding, validation without stakeholder trace, unmanaged assumption, and mismatched configuration index.

**Independent final work**

1. Run the full consistency checklist from Section 16.
2. Reproduce the trade calculation and sample ten requirement traces.
3. Close or explicitly accept every review finding with authority and evidence.
4. Produce the executive recommendation, technical report, final briefing, and evidence index.
5. Tag `BL3-Concept` and verify a clean checkout reproduces the package.
6. Record a 20-minute oral defense using the twelve capstone prompts.
7. Complete a one-page self-critique and `662_handoff.md`.

**Final deliverable**

The complete capstone package specified in Section 16. No additional artifact is accepted as a substitute for the controlled baseline, review evidence, and oral defense.

**Final assessment rubric — 100 points**

Use the standard course rubric in Section 14, with the following capstone emphasis:

| Dimension | Points |
|---|---:|
| Technical correctness and lifecycle completeness | 25 |
| End-to-end traceability and consistency | 25 |
| Decision, risk, and uncertainty quality | 15 |
| Realization/V&V evidence strategy | 15 |
| Executive/technical communication | 10 |
| Oral defense, revision, and configuration integrity | 10 |

All Section 15 noncompensable criteria apply.

**Final knowledge check — synthesis prompts**

1. Show a complete mission-to-evidence trace. 2. Defend the system boundary. 3. Identify the recommendation’s sensitivity threshold. 4. Explain the highest residual risk. 5. Distinguish the most important verification and validation activities. 6. Identify one enabling system that could invalidate the concept. 7. Explain the most consequential review-driven change. 8. Identify one requirement likely to be rewritten during detailed design. 9. State which evidence remains an estimate rather than observation. 10. Recommend the next course and the first inherited artifact to revise.

**Mastery decision**

Apply the completion standard in Section 15. When the learner does not pass, issue specific remediation findings rather than restarting the entire course. Typical remediation paths are requirements/traceability repair, decision-model reproduction, architecture/interface repair, V&V correction, or a second oral defense.

**Time budget:** final audit 2.0 hr; revisions 3.0–5.0 hr; report/briefing 2.0 hr; defense and self-critique 1.0 hr; total approximately 8–10 hours.

### 11B. Weekly solution and instructor-material package

To keep the student-facing weeks usable, maintain the following separate-but-integrated folders under `/00_admin/instructor_materials`. These are part of the curriculum repository but should not be consulted before the corresponding independent attempt.

| Week | Required solution or support material |
|---:|---|
| 1 | Bicycle-share boundary reference rationale; glossary key; context-diagram defect checklist |
| 2 | Three-project lifecycle comparison; tailoring decision examples; review-map key |
| 3 | Annotated stakeholder interview normalization; reference scenario set; MOE/MOP/TPM classification key |
| 4 | Defective-requirement answer key; acceptable rewrite variants; trace/metadata validation workbook |
| 5 | Functional-label correction key; sample behavioral thread; state-model findings checklist |
| 6 | Mini-baseline review answer set; finding severity rationale; example approval-with-actions memo |
| 7 | Interface-classification key; sample interface sheet; allocation audit formulas |
| 8 | Formula-checked AHP/weighted-model workbook; sensitivity reference results; trade-study defect key |
| 9 | Risk/issue/assumption classification key; risk rewrite examples; CM audit checklist |
| 10 | Source-grounded Mars Climate Orbiter finding map; inference/evidence guide; sample systemic actions |
| 11 | Activity-classification key; V&V method rationale; example integration entry/exit criteria |
| 12 | Mini-baseline consistency defect key; oral-defense scoring sheet; remediation-finding templates |

Every solution should explain the reasoning, identify acceptable alternatives, and state common misconceptions. Open-ended case assignments should receive a reference rationale and rubric, not a falsely unique “correct architecture.”


### 12. Major assignments and review gates

| Assignment or review | Due | Outcomes assessed | Inputs | Required outputs | Feedback and revision |
|---|---:|---|---|---|---|
| System framing and lifecycle memo | 2 | CLO-1, CLO-2 | Sponsor brief and environment description | Context, hierarchy, boundary alternatives, lifecycle map, tailoring rationale | Checklist plus reference rationale; required correction of boundary defects |
| Needs, ConOps, and measures baseline | 3 | CLO-3 | Stakeholder profiles and operating map | Stakeholder register, needs, scenarios, ConOps outline, MOEs/MOPs | Rubric and trace review; revised into `BL1-Needs` |
| Requirements and functional architecture package | 5 | CLO-4, CLO-5 | `BL1-Needs` | Requirement set, trace matrix, verification approach, functional decomposition and flows | Automated spreadsheet checks plus reference examples |
| Midcourse Functional Baseline Review | 6 | CLO-1–5, CLO-10 | Weeks 1–5 baseline | Ten-minute briefing, review checklist, findings, dispositions, revised `BL2-Functional` | Mandatory revision; unresolved major findings block Week 7 baseline approval |
| Concept trade study | 8 | CLO-6 | Three or more architecture concepts and evaluation criteria | AHP/weighted analysis, consistency check, sensitivity analysis, recommendation, decision record | Independent recalculation and red-team weight changes |
| Technical-management mini-baseline | 9 | CLO-7, CLO-8 | Selected concept and controlled artifacts | SEMP outline, WBS/PBS crosswalk, risk register, CM index, TPM set, assessment plan | Rubric, risk-statement diagnostic, and required CM audit |
| Failure-analysis and red-team memo | 10 | CLO-4, CLO-5, CLO-7–10 | Mars Climate Orbiter source packet and case baseline | Causal map, failed controls, evidence gaps, corrective actions, case red-team findings | Compare with investigation findings; revise at least three case artifacts |
| Concept Review | 11 | CLO-1–10 | Draft integrated baseline | Fifteen-minute review, evidence index, review record, corrective-action plan | Simulated review board; every finding dispositioned before final submission |
| Final capstone and oral defense | 12 | CLO-1–10 | Revised baseline | Final controlled package, report, briefing, defense, retrospective | Final rubric and mastery decision |

### 13. Feedback and self-evaluation plan

The course uses six complementary feedback mechanisms:

1. **Analytic rubrics** for every major artifact.
2. **Reference rationales and annotated examples** for boundary choices, requirement defects, function decomposition, trade studies, and risk statements.
3. **Automated or formula-based checks** for unique identifiers, missing traces, AHP matrix reciprocity and consistency, risk scoring, and verification coverage.
4. **Structured technical reviews** in Weeks 6 and 11 using entry criteria, findings severity, action ownership, and closure evidence.
5. **Red-team review** in Week 10, requiring the learner to challenge the case baseline from operator, maintainer, safety, cybersecurity, supplier, and accessibility perspectives.
6. **Recorded explanation and self-critique** for the Week 8 trade decision and Week 12 oral defense.

Required revision affects the course score. A revised artifact receives credit for closing findings only when the change is technically adequate, traceability is restored, the change log is complete, and side effects are checked.

### 14. Standard course rubric

Use this rubric for major integrated assignments and the capstone. Weekly assignments may use a reduced version.

| Dimension | Weight | Exemplary | Proficient | Developing | Insufficient |
|---|---:|---|---|---|---|
| Technical correctness | 20% | Methods and results are correct; distinctions and limitations are handled explicitly | Minor errors do not change conclusions | Several errors weaken confidence | Fundamental errors invalidate major conclusions |
| Completeness and lifecycle scope | 15% | Required elements, relevant lifecycle stages, and important off-nominal cases are addressed | Required elements are substantially present | Important elements or lifecycle concerns are incomplete | Major required elements are absent |
| Traceability and cross-artifact consistency | 20% | Needs, requirements, functions, architecture, interfaces, risks, decisions, and V&V are coherently linked | Traceability is substantially complete with minor gaps | Multiple orphans, contradictions, or mismatched identifiers remain | Critical trace chains are absent or contradictory |
| Assumptions, uncertainty, and rationale | 15% | Assumptions and uncertainty are explicit; decisions remain defensible under sensitivity checks | Main assumptions and rationale are stated | Important assumptions are hidden or rationale is thin | Conclusions are unsupported or misleading |
| Evidence, verification, and reviewability | 15% | Evidence is appropriate, reproducible, indexed, and sufficient for each claim | Evidence generally supports claims | Evidence is incomplete or weakly matched | Evidence is absent, fabricated, or irrelevant |
| Communication and configuration quality | 15% | Clear, concise, audience-appropriate, reproducible, and under effective configuration control | Understandable and organized with minor defects | Difficult to review or inconsistently controlled | Unclear, disorganized, or not reproducible |

### 15. Critical criteria and mastery gates

A learner cannot pass by point accumulation alone.

**Noncompensable criteria**

* every mission- or safety-critical stakeholder need must trace to one or more requirements or an explicit disposition;
* every critical requirement must have an identified verification method and success criterion at an appropriate level;
* no unresolved contradiction may remain among the selected concept, requirement baseline, functional architecture, physical architecture, and interface register;
* the selected concept must be supported by a reproducible decision analysis and explicit assumptions;
* risk entries must distinguish cause, uncertain event, and consequence, with an owner and response strategy for every high risk;
* all review findings must be closed, downgraded with evidence, or explicitly accepted as residual risk;
* no fabricated, unacknowledged, or irreproducible evidence is permitted;
* the learner must personally defend the submitted work.

**Completion standard**

* at least 80% overall;
* at least 70% in every assessment category;
* at least 80% on the final capstone;
* Proficient or better on every critical capstone rubric dimension;
* successful oral defense, with no major misconception left unresolved after follow-up questioning.

A score of 85% in this self-study course is a personal mastery benchmark only; it does not activate the JHU/INCOSE Academic Equivalency benefit.

### 16. Capstone specification

* the V&V concept distinguishes verification from validation and links both to acceptance evidence;
* the configuration index matches the final repository contents and baseline tag.

**Review format**

Conduct a Concept Review with the learner acting as lead systems engineer. The simulated review board should represent the sponsor, operator, passenger/accessibility advocate, safety authority, maintainer, cybersecurity lead, project manager, and integration/test lead. When no external reviewers are available, use the supplied role-based question bank, record the review, pause after each role, and answer from that stakeholder perspective before completing a self-critique.

**Oral defense prompts**

1. Why did you draw the system boundary where you did, and what would change under the strongest alternative boundary?
2. Which stakeholder need is most difficult to satisfy, and how is that difficulty visible in the requirements and architecture?
3. Which requirement is carrying the greatest design risk, and why?
4. Show one complete trace from mission objective through need, requirement, function, architecture element, interface, and planned evidence.
5. Which trade-study assumption most affects the recommendation?
6. What does the AHP consistency result tell you, and what does it not tell you?
7. Which interface is most likely to fail during integration, and how will that risk be reduced or detected?
8. What is the difference between verifying the shuttle's emergency-stop capability and validating the emergency-response service?
9. Which major review finding caused the most consequential revision?
10. What important uncertainty remains unresolved, who owns it, and when must it be resolved?
11. Which systems-engineering process did you tailor most aggressively, and why is the remaining rigor sufficient?
12. Which next course should inherit this baseline, and what should it change first?

### 17. Portfolio and course-exit package

* decision, assumption, change, and findings logs;
* Week 6 and Week 11 review packages with dispositions;
* final executive memo, technical report, and briefing;
* oral-defense recording or transcript;
* one-page retrospective identifying strengths, limitations, and preparation needed for EN.645.667, EN.645.631, and EN.645.764.

**Course-exit handoff note**

Create `662_handoff.md` describing:

* the authoritative baseline and repository tag;
* unresolved risks and assumptions;
* artifacts safe to reuse without modification;
* artifacts that are preliminary and must be rebuilt in later courses;
* recommended next course and the reason it is appropriate.
